I will have some comments at the end of the presentation. But I do want to just begin by saying that we all know that we've known for a while that we have some some years where because of what we're paying into our largely unfunded pension liabilities that we had had some deficits. We've been planning for those. We've been working hard to make investments. And through economic development, I think our team has been doing a great job at at eliminating that and lowering that deficit as much as possible. And so I think what you're going to hear tonight is, is some good news that we're moving in the right direction and that while we still have a challenge, the challenge is even a little more manageable than we thought it was a few months ago. And so I'm really happy to hear and I think the council will be happy to hear tonight's presentation.\\nSpeaker 10: Mr. WEST Thank you, Mayor and council members. We've been asked to update you tonight on the most recent projections for the fiscal year 16 budget through fiscal year 18. The past three years we've experienced budget stability. However, fiscal year 17 and fiscal year 18 have been projected to have shortfalls. Therefore, we have been closely monitoring revenues and expenses, and we do have a preliminary, preliminarily updated outlook for the next three years. The good news is that even though the price of oil is continuing to decline, other revenues have offset this reduction. And so instead of facing a $7.5 million shortfall for next year, our preliminary outlook is that we are now looking at a shortfall of 5.1 million.\\nSpeaker 9: We will be taking steps to proactively address this shortfall, which, while difficult, is.\\nSpeaker 10: Manageable compared to the deficits of the past when we were cutting 20 million to $38 million each year. I will now turn it over to Assistant Finance Director Lisa Erickson, who will describe the changes to the three year outlook and the approach we plan to take to address the budget shortfalls. Lisa.\\nSpeaker 1: Good evening, Mayor and members of City Council. First, I'm going to start with a review of the current year that for the FY16 budget that we just passed last year, two months ago, it was based on an improving economy and it was balanced as a result of discipline and prudent decisions. It contained no service reductions. It also included funding for both police and fire academies. And we are working to maximize the police academy and in fact, are working to conduct two academies in police academies this year.\\nSpeaker 0: Real quickly, I'm sorry, when the announcement it didn't make a case you were here for item 24. Is that item 24 has been withdrawn? I didn't mention that. So I don't want anybody waiting. So 24 has been withdrawn. Leah, continue.\\nSpeaker 1: We've also continued to work on outstanding financial issues and cost savings, and the budget included a projected structural surplus of $675,000 and that does appear to be on target. We are carefully monitoring this budget, though, for key revenue and expense items that are impacting the outlook for this year and the next two years. So on the revenue side, we have positive revenue impacts that are helping the outlook. Our sales tax is stronger than projected due to economic growth and also due to some economic development agreements, including CRC Services, Office Depot, Human and Worthington. We've also had a stronger transit occupancy tax performance due to economic growth and our property tax has higher residual property tax growth from the RTA dissolution. We have the new fee implemented for first responder fee that's helping the revenue. And then also we have stronger electric duty and lease revenue from the pike. On the negative side for revenues, our property tax is also being hurt though by low oil prices, which is reducing the value of oil related properties. And also our uplands oil revenue is coming in lower because of the reduced price per barrel. On the expenditure side, we have positive expense impacts, including our open space bond debt service, which was going to be a general fund obligation is now going to be paid by RTA city loan repayments per the state. And also we are proposing to make our CalPERS stabilization fund contribution in FY 17 by using one time revenues from 15 year end surplus rather than structurally building it in the budget. Negative expense impacts are the R&D termination is causing increase expense in the fire department. However, we are anticipating that that would be covered by the first responder fee and if needed, the 15 year end surplus. And then also we have some county park fund funded maintenance. That is because of the ballot initiative. Failing last year is now a general fund expense starting in up by 17. We have some assumptions and uncertainties used in this outlook, including the fact that we're assuming CalPERS costs are locked through FY18 and the low investment returns of last year, though, will mean that we are going to be needing to draw down or CalPERS stabilization fund in 18. We're continuing to assume that the economy is good, but that is uncertain and difficult to predict. We are now assuming oil at $45 a barrel for 16 instead of 55, which was what the budget was based on. And we're looking at $50 a barrel for 17 and 18 instead of 60 and 65. This is also very uncertain and difficult to predict. We're also continuing not to assume any raises or takeaways due to current or upcoming labor negotiations. And I should note that the projection will change based on the 6xy 16 status as the year continues and along with any new information. So as as the city manager mentioned, the outlook has improved. We had a surplus in 16 both years and we were looking at a seven and a half million dollar shortfall in 17 and an additional $7.8 million shortfall in 18 for a cumulative 15.3 million. We're now looking at a 5.1 million shortfall in 17 and 5.2 million in 18 due to all those revenue and expense impact changes that I described before. So that's a $10.3 million cumulative shortfall, which is 5 million better than originally projected. And the fact that we did not spend the 16 temporary temporary surplus does mean that the 17 deficit was reduced from 5.8 to 5.1 million. And that amount is not at the level of the cuts that were that were needed during the Great Recession, as the city manager mentioned, which was 20 million or $38 million, depending on the year. And while this fiscal outlook for 16 and 18 is better than the original projection, this is on top of the already cut cuts of $134 million in almost 700 positions since I was seven. And we're also looking that it looks like likely that the shortfalls will continue through FY 20 due to continued low oil prices and pension cost increases that were planned. And this is a preliminary outlook and it will be updated later and up by 16, and it could change materially at that time. So our approach for the budget is for up 16, we want to be cautious. We are exploring general fund department budget savings targets, which would begin in January in order to ensure that 16 remains in balance and to generate funds for one time purposes, including that second police academy cost, which is likely to also need 15 year end surplus funds as well. And then we're looking. These cuts would be in order to help prepare for FY17 by initiating some savings. Now, that could help to balance fiscal year 17 and beyond. 417 Our approach is to allow no service enhancements without offsetting reductions, to continue to develop efficiencies and cost reductions to focus our one time expenditures on reducing cost and meeting critical needs. To focus on economic development. To continue to grow that our revenue base and identify potential new revenues and develop approaches to meeting any reduction targets that are needed. And we're going to also be working with our employees to secure fair agreements that recognize the value of our employees while also addressing our fiscal realities. So in summary, in our next steps, as Long Beach is projected to do better than earlier anticipated, but we must continue to take steps to address this new economic reality. And we need to reduce our expenditure growth to match that limited revenue growth. And this preliminary budget projected shortfall of 5.1 million equates to 1.3% of the departmental budgets. And while this is difficult, it is manageable due to mayors and city councils, discipline and fiscal restraint. However, we do need to stay focused on our core services given our limited resource capacity. City staff will continue to evaluate our financial projections, and we'll be updating City Council in February with the 15 year end status and will return in March with updated estimates for the 17 through Fy19 outlook. This concludes my presentation and I am available for any questions you may have.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I'm going to make a couple of couple brief comments and then I'm to turn this over to to the council. Let me just be just begin by saying that I'm really obviously very proud that the council has maintained a level of fiscal responsibility the last few years. It's certainly something that started a few years ago when we were experiencing major deficits. I think if we all remember and think back to 2009, where I think our deficit was close to $40 million for that one year alone. And so to have gone from a $40 million deficit down to we went down to I think it was 28 and then down to in the teens and then continuingly to drop that deficit down to where it were. We had a few years of a small surplus and now back down and to to to a deficit that certainly it's there, it's real. But it's also, I think, manageable. And I think if you think about what that means from a from a fiscal perspective, you're really talking about one point at 1.3% a piece of that general fund budget which listen, we are the services that we currently have in place are all important, they're all valuable. But it is something that we can manage and is not the type of of of tough times that we certainly had five or six years ago. While the budget is better than expected and is going in the right direction, that doesn't mean that we can somehow loosen the belt and and overspend. I think that something it's really important for this council is the reason why our budget continues to improve is because we continue to be fiscally responsible. And so that measure of responsibility needs to continue if we want to continue to see these types of of of better days ahead of us. Let me also just say that one thing we should be considering is if budget trends continue and this deficit has now reduced and we'll get a better picture, you know, when we're in February and March. And obviously we all hope that it keeps going in this direction while 1% is manageable. I think we can all agree that in certain parts of divisions of our city, any type of cut would be devastating. And I think we can think certainly of our police department, which right now, quite frankly, is stretched to the bone. I can't think of a of a of a group of officers anywhere in the country that do as much as our officers do with the resources that they have. And so any kind of cut, I think, to our to the men and women of the police department would be very, very difficult. So this is a real challenge, but I think it's one that will hopefully have a robust conversation over over the course of the next few months. And so we decided to do this budget presentation kind of ahead of the normal budget cycle. Normally you would hear this, I think, in January or February, but in talking to the city manager, I felt it was important that they start getting this information out. Earlier so that we can plan ahead sooner rather than later. And so with that, I'm going to open this up for counsel, comments and input. And it's also, I think our hope that through the BRC there could be some conversations even earlier than we would normally start so that we can address these things sooner rather than later . And so so some good news, but certainly some challenges that we still need to deal with. So Councilman Richardson, who has made the motion to receive and file your first.\\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and thank you, city staff and Mayor Garcia for including us in this update. Sooner than than normal. And I would just say it is certainly welcome news that we're trending in the right direction. We definitely should be watchful and careful. But I would I would I know that there's a lot at stake here in terms of our public safety and our core services and our frontline, like our rank and file that we don't want to we don't want to have to cut those core services. I want to just check in and just ask our city manager for a quick update. I know that we've had a conversation about and I see that you're tracking the first responder fee and that will have a conversation about a month or so. But how's everything coming so far with the in terms of the first responder fee? How's it looking?\\nSpeaker 1: Well, Councilman Richardson, we had implemented the first responder fee just last month. And due to collection cycles, we don't have any information on an actual revenue received at this point.\\nSpeaker 3: Great. So I'm just looking forward to that. I know that we gave it 60 days or so, so that should come back some time in in in December. Thank you so much for the presentation.\\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Next up is Councilman Andrew. Did you have any you want to speak to your second?\\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. I just wanted to let you know that I'm very pleased to, you know, see the item on the agenda tonight and that you've taken, you know, a large step, you know, to see that, you know, preparedness. But, you know, by 17. So thank you very much.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Vice Mayor Lowenthal.\\nSpeaker 5: Just a quick thank you to Ms.. Erickson and Mr. GROSS for preparing this, but also for ensuring that the council priorities are adhered to and observed. And you're very clear that this council does not want to impact services to the residents or negatively impact our employees. And so I thank you for that, and I thank you for the early notice. That's always I, I feel like this is a first in a very long time that we've had a very early report on what we're looking at. So thank you.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo.\\nSpeaker 1: I have so much respect and appreciation for Mr. GROSS and Leia and the work that we have done together over the last year. I am just continually impressed by the thoughtful nature of the work that you do. I know that in the beginning we talked about changing the game a little bit, and I appreciate that the council supported me in bringing greater transparency to our sales tax revenues and our business district impact on the revenue of our city. I want to give a special thanks to you'll notice that the report discusses increases in our sales tax revenue associated with Worthington Ford and human Toyota and their partnership. I want to give a special thanks to the Southern California Association of Car Dealers for coming to the table and talking through opportunities and threats to the industry. Staying in Long Beach, what it means to tell the message of of of the great deal of benefit that comes from buying your car and repairing your car in Long Beach. Also, I want to thank the business associations. I think that the new format of the way that we present the sales tax revenue really helps them advocate for bringing additional business to their corridors. I know it's helped us in the fifth District. And then additionally, I really want to thank my colleagues. I have seen in the last 18 months innovation of of opportunities for Long Beach residents to spend their weekends and evenings in Long Beach learning about Long Beach and celebrating Long Beach. And when we do that, our residents stay here and they spend their money here, and we can earn back that leakage in the sales tax revenue that we had before. We don't have specific other businesses on here, but there are a few who were either thinking of leaving or left for a short period of time and came back. And they have 20, 40, 100, $200,000 per entity of impact on the general fund sales tax revenue annually. And I think that what this this really goes to is a collaboration really led and supported by our mayor and our colleagues that has never been seen before in Long Beach. And I know that it was a tough pill to swallow in the beginning because there's a lot of extra work for our finance department. But what gets measured is really what gets focused on, and I think that we've seen that in the results. So a big win for for the finance department and the council for supporting this additional transparency. Thank you. Thank you so much.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And before I open this up for public comment, I want to say and I say this every time we talk about the budget, but I just really think it's important to remember. And for me, it's an important part of our kind of planning for these deficits, is that Long Beach has these small deficits not because we hired a bunch of employees or because we are all of a sudden overspending. But these are employee these deficits are directly related to the larger pension payment that the city is now making and has been making over the last few years. And so I say that because we are what we're doing now essentially is being responsible about paying down our long term pension obligation, which then creates us managing through these additional deficits. And if the city was not paying what we're paying now and reducing the pension, we wouldn't have these deficits. And so I think that that's it's smart planning. I'm glad that the state went once the city had implemented pension reform, the state followed and is now encouraging other cities to do what we're doing now. But it's long term, it's the smart thing to do. And so while no one likes to have deficits, even when they're small, it does force the city to spend responsibly and to invest in the long term health of the city. And so I wanted to make sure that that that was mentioned again. Is there any public comment on the budget presentation? And then after that, we'll go right into public comment.\\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, Larry. Do Kirk has the address? Yes. Mr. GROSS and his staff are to be commended for those figures. And I think it argues well argues well for the city to do what I've suggested a number of times is to get a first rate city manager to manage these very difficult times. We cannot rely on a fourth rate. Peter Principal Manager selected because the more qualified assistant city manager could not be lead, would not be bullied. So we ended up with what we have. I think it argues well, also for going back to what works so well for so many years is a part time. They're selected by the city council. We don't need a globetrotting, globetrotting political hack to how to run the city. Thank you.\\nSpeaker 0: Always instructive. Thank you. Any other public comment on this item? C none members please cast on receive and file. And of course, and thanks again to the finance staff for your work and we look forward to the next presentation at the.\\nSpeaker 1: Motion carry in.\\nSpeaker 0: February. Thank you very much. Let's go ahead and go now through. We have public comment and consent. Let me get a motion for consent real quick. Going to get a motion in a second. There's a motion in a second for consent.\",\n          \"Speaker 1: Thank you. Thank you, Miss Butler. It's always nice to get fans we weren't anticipating. And that's what we have here. And thank you for your report. And Madam Kirk, do we have public speakers on this item?\\nSpeaker 0: We do not. Okay.\\nSpeaker 1: Well, counsel, it's if we have no public speakers, then I'm going to go ahead. They're going to go ahead and close public comment and we will just launch right into council questions, comments, motion, what have you. So Council, what's your pleasure, Councilmember Herrera Spencer and then Councilmember Knox.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mayor, and thank you, Jack, for this report. I'd like some more information about the all of these items. How, for instance, how did you come up with the ratio? Is there some formula that the reference of the 125,000, if I heard correctly, and I read this correctly, it's ten persons, but I don't know for how many nights. And I'd like to actually know what is the cost per night that you're estimating. And then the second one, the Street Outreach, Mental Health. Do we have an organization right now that you're working with that you're extending what is the 75,000 buy and then the last digit, the amount that.\\nSpeaker 1: 85,000.\\nSpeaker 0: Is actually the most broad. That could actually be my preference. And I don't know if you could allocate more money to that. I really like the idea of that includes assistance for car repairs, paying back rent and utilities for previously homeless or those most vulnerable are on the verge of becoming homeless. And this to me is actually, if I'm understanding correctly, is the most similar to some sort of universal basic income where we help, we treat people that they know that they how to spend the money work best and can get the most bang out of it. And I think that that might actually be my highest priority is where I think it could be most efficient. But so I would like more information of, you know, what is the cost per night for the overnight shelter. I think maybe some people can figure it out, maybe lower if we give them more money to spend. Thanks. Okay. So I don't have the cost per night, but I could probably calculate it. I would need to go through my notes for that. What I do, what I do have is that. And the way we the way that it was figured out was we were trying to have a stopgap measure for a for for shelter. We need a way to put people in shelter temporarily. It cost about $100 per night to have people in in shelter temporarily. And this would allow us to get some of the most vulnerable off the street. People say that they don't have a place to stay at all, and that's why they're setting up camp in our city. We would be able to move them temporarily to a shelter. So I will I will come back to that item. As far as as the other items are concerned, mental health, we do have a provider that we're working with that that does provide mental health services that could tack on to what they are providing. We have not negotiated a deal with them, but we we have talked I have talked to them about perhaps having them work with some of our moderate and extreme mental health folks that that that we have in and that are homeless in Alameda that were trying to get in into permanent housing. But we can't do that because their health condition is such that they can't be trusted in housing at this point. And then with the flexible funds, the amount was based on being able to provide the temporary shelter and the mental health service, and that was the remaining amount. So I will get back to you on the the shelter item. Okay. You have to do a calculation.\\nSpeaker 1: And Councilmember Harris, as you had more questions.\\nSpeaker 0: So I would like to know who that provider is that you're looking that's currently working with the city that you're looking at extending. Um, the, the shelter, the, the case provider would be Operation Dignity. Thank you.\\nSpeaker 1: I had a question having to do with mental health assistance, Mr. Butler. Is it possible if we were to augment the amount we're spending on those services now, that we could have someone on call 24 seven for somebody who's just having an episode and looks like they could use some assistance, as.\\nSpeaker 0: Does.\\nSpeaker 1: Operation Dignity. I think they do outreach. Outreach, correct. And what you know, what are their what are their what's their structure now? Is it Monday through Friday certain hours? Is it on the weekend?\\nSpeaker 0: No, it's not on the weekend. It's Monday through Friday. Mm hmm.\\nSpeaker 1: So would there be a possibility of extending to the weekends and maybe the evenings?\\nSpeaker 0: We could look at doing that with the dollars instead of doing the mental health piece. Are you? Are you? We don't have them doing any mental health. Okay.\\nSpeaker 1: I was confused when you said Operation Dignity. I was. Yeah. So who who would be providing the mental health services?\\nSpeaker 0: What I would be proposing is operation. Technically, they provide it in other jurisdictions within hours. Got it.\\nSpeaker 1: Do we not currently provide some mental health assistance to our homeless population?\\nSpeaker 0: No, we only provide case management. Hmm.\\nSpeaker 1: Got it. Okay, so this would actually be something new. We're starting. Okay. Okay. Okay. Well, then I could see the I could see the the reasoning for starting with a monday through Friday model. But hopefully, perhaps if it's successful, it could be expanded to to longer, because I think we could probably all agree that people that just have their mental health crises Monday through Friday. Okay, I, I have some other thoughts, but I'd love to hear from the rest of the council council members. Anybody want to add anything or to be like these recommendations? Council member, not quite when it was.\\nSpeaker 2: Ready to move the staff recommendation. I think they did a great job and I just want to thank them for their work. They moved the staff recommendation. Okay.\\nSpeaker 1: And did. Okay. Let's have a say and then maybe have a just a little bit more discussion. Council member, they said, are you seconding? Okay, perfect. We've had a motion by council member that's. Wait a second. By councilor would decide the. I just wanted to. I love everything you proposed. Ms.. Butler and then on the page three where it says if well, it's a carryover from page two, if other funding is sufficient to address the mental illness needs of the city's housed staff recommends that the proposed mental health funding referenced above be divided between and allocated to the other two categories, that being increasing the 67,000 plus fortnightly shelter to 185,000 plus, and then increasing the flexible funds from 14,000 some to 100,000. Alternatively, the funds could be used for transitional housing programs such as the community cabins. I might like to see some of that money going to try to help get those shelters where people could go. That I do think more than 14,000 for flexible funds is a good thing and jumping it all the way up to 100,000. That's quite a bit. And again, this is only if we find that there's funding coming in to cover the mental health services that Ms.. Butler's proposing. But I. Anybody else have any thoughts about that? Ms.. Butler ahead.\\nSpeaker 0: I should say that this cut, the funding cut, can span over a couple of years. It's not just a one year funding amount. And so the the moneys for the flexible funds, which just extend for a longer period of time. Okay. Okay.\\nSpeaker 1: I thank you for that clarification. What period of time are we talking about?\\nSpeaker 0: Currently the funding would probably last about a year, just over a year and a half. And if you extended it, it would last approximately two years. Okay.\\nSpeaker 1: Thank you for that clarification. Okay. Councilmember Herrera Spencer.\\nSpeaker 0: Q In regards to mental health services, I don't know if we've looked in at Almeida Family Services, and I know they provide quite a bit of mental health support to other APEC, I believe, as well as our schools. And obviously within the community they offer quite a bit of counseling. So I don't know if you checked with them, if they would be eligible to help with any of your ideas. But I, we we could we could extend it. We could do an RFP for these services. We don't have to go with the entity that I spoke with. It was just that I spoke with them because they do provide it in other locations. It's my understanding when analysts here she had spoken to Alameda Family Services in the past for services and they they are interested in providing services but maybe not of this type. I can go back to them and speak with them about that again. And then APEC, I was not aware that they provided mental health services, so I can also speak with them. Family Services at least provide some mental health services to APC. Sorry if I misspoke. Okay. I really value our services of the different locations within the community already. And I and I this my understanding that they have the capability to do the Weekender 24 seven services. Well, I can I can definitely speak with them. So just this is, you know, something to look into. But regardless of the formula, how is it the bet is that this.\\nSpeaker 1: This allocation.\\nSpeaker 0: Really the best use of.\\nSpeaker 1: The money?\\nSpeaker 0: I'm not really sure because I'm not really sure what it's based on. But I, I do like with, you know, flexible funds and letting it can go to a lot of different options. So I just think that so when you're saying the one 2575 and then the 86, is that like at some point it means the city gets these means that they could reallocate depending upon what things actually cost and where we actually see the greater need to meet people's needs. Yes. So to answer your first question about the the cost, it would be $1,250 a week, and that would be five, five days a week. Just $50 plus the weekends. So it would be seven days a week. And then your second question. I'm sorry, I was doing the calculation to try to get you your information. What was the second question going back to the first one then? Is it how many days does. Over a year? It's over a year, 50 to 52 days and ten people. And it's $1,250 a week. Okay. So depending upon if that really is the best uses the program unfolds, I'd like to hope that we can have some flexibility there because I think keeping people in their homes might actually be a good use of that tool, which is the flexibility issue option.\\nSpeaker 1: Anything for the second baseman, Avila. Okay. Vice mayor of L.A..\\nSpeaker 0: It just we know that our unhoused population has grown. We have a significant need with the folks that are going to our shelter. We also know that they do not have a place to go at night. And I think that this is a good opportunity. I think that what we are going to find is that this is insufficient to serve. That need is substantially insufficient. This is not a huge amount of money that we're talking about. I'm very supportive of the staff recommendation. I think it is trying to maximize the space that we have at our data center while still addressing with dignity the needs of the folks that we have. So I'm prepared to support the proposal tonight. And I also just think that at the end of the day, I also want to be cognizant of staff time. We are having this staff work on a number of different issues. And so I actually don't support having them try to go back and kind of do work a second time. We keep bringing up Alameda Point or we keep bringing up different vendors relative to the mental health services. We have vendors that are already operating in this space and so are providers, I should say. And I think that we need to honor the work that's been done rather than second guessing it and, you know, move forward with this. I think there's going to be other opportunities. This is not something where I think that, you know, an RFP or anything like that is needed. I think it would actually delay providing these services that are very, very much needed. That's all.\\nSpeaker 1: I would say I agree with that approach. Anyone else want to add anything before we vote on approving the staff proposal? Remind me. We had a motion by Council member Knox White and it was seconded right. By former SA. Correct.\\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\\nSpeaker 1: All right, then. Well, let's take a roll call vote, if we could, please. Madam Clerk.\\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember de SAG. Yes. Herrera. Spencer, I.\\nSpeaker 2: Knox Light. Hi.\\nSpeaker 0: Fella. I mayor as Ashcraft high.\\nSpeaker 1: That carries by five eyes. Great. Thank you. And Ms.. Butler, thank you again for all your hard work in following up on this. It is so important we have not had a place in Alameda where every day of the year there is someplace that an and sheltered person could lay down their head and have a roof over their head. And so now this is an important first step toward doing that. So thank you so much for all your hard work and we'll look forward to hearing more from you.\\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\\nSpeaker 1: All right. So with that, we're going to close. I turn six B and we're moving on to item 60. Madam Kirk, will you introduce that item for us, please?\\nSpeaker 0: Recommendation to assign a portion of the 28.68 million funding from the federal government through the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to assist this recovery from the impacts of the COVID 19 pandemic.\\nSpeaker 1: Right. Who doesn't like talking about money coming into the city, huh? And I see some familiar financial faces. We have our finance director and Anita, we have Jennifer, 12, also from finance. And I think. Do you ladies have a presentation? I believe you've got a PowerPoint. Is that you, city manager?\\nSpeaker 2: No, I think. Mr. Bowden, are you. Oh, I'm so sorry. Yeah, I'm going to try. I'm going to do the presentation, but these folks are critical to the conversation. So we'll tag team the responses and Q&A segment. All right. Thank you. Good evening.\\nSpeaker 1: Anyway.\\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much. Council members, we have another update for you on the the American Rescue Plan Act funding. We hope that the conversation tonight starts to start to funnel our our priorities into a particular direction. Next slide, please. And thank you. So as you all know, we've got $28.68 million in ARPA funding coming to the city of Alameda on June 17th. We received our first tranche, which is a $14.34 million, and we had City Council direction on this topic back in May. There were a couple of themes to the meeting in May. One of the things that we took away from that meeting was setting up a framework for us to be able to allocate these funds. So we did set up some guiding principles for council's consideration this evening. We also distilled down the topic from the main meeting into four topic areas supplementing revenue loss. This is general fund revenue. Loss was one of the topic areas. Addressing housing, homelessness and behavioral health matters was another topic area building broadband infrastructure in the community and really investing in that in that key and really underinvested in piece of infrastructure in the community was another topic area that came to light. And then finally the household and local small business assistance programing, which which is essentially a bucket at this point. There is no program designed around this like we had with prior funding sources. First, with respect to COVID, COVID response and recovery, the monies are intended to be a response to COVID. So that is a critical, critical theme, underlying theme that needs to be considered throughout the discussion. Next slide. So these are the guiding principles. There are eight of them on the screen. The ones that I guess all I'll I'll call out this this information is all fleshed out a little further in the staff report. But we did want to make sure that we called out the equity lens as a particular item that we're wanted to emphasize with the ARPA dollars. This is a response to COVID. And COVID did impact certain certain elements in our community, certain folks in our community, more so than others. And so as we look to funding opportunities, this is a way to to ensure that we are spreading those resources a little more generously to areas that were harder hit by the pandemic and the impacts also that the general fund has taken a hit during COVID, and we did bring in less revenue. And so the idea of being able to top up the general fund, which does provide services across the community, is is a topic area that we wanted to make sure was in there. And finally, the one time expenditures element was a theme that we pulled out as well from the the main the main discussion. This is this is one time money. So anything that we create that creates an ongoing operational cost is going to be something that the city's general fund or other funding sources would have to absorb. So with that, we'll say next slide, please, and thank you. The interim final rule is really what guides the the elements that are eligible for the that the spending. There are there are some pretty big buckets there. We did using the interim final rule, using the the guiding principles, using the city council priorities that had been established\",\n          \"Speaker 0: Motion carry.\\nSpeaker 6: Annexes. Item number 28.\\nSpeaker 0: Item 28 is a communication from Councilwoman Mango Councilwoman Price Council Member Muranga Councilman Austin Recommendation to require City Manager to work with Technology and Innovation Department and report back within 180 days on the potential cost, benefits, partnerships and challenges of a city of Long Beach issued ID card.\\nSpeaker 6: As a member. Mungo Thank.\\nSpeaker 5: You. I know earlier this year a member of the community stated that they don't always know what the council agenda item is by the verbiage that's on the screen. So I'm going to read you the subject line of the agenda item. The Long Beach one card streamlining, resident connectivity and access to city services. I brought this item as a continuation of making sure that we're putting forward best practices to ensure that our residents have the capability to easily engage and access the things that matter most to them, whether it's providing department or policy feedback, reporting a pothole, finding a library program, looking for a free, family friendly event, or renting a park space for a birthday. All of those activities could be streamlined into one easy place for residents to access. Currently, a resident might have up to nine different accounts in the city. They might have their library card number, their gas card number, their gas account number. They might make reservations at Parks and Rec. And each and every time they have a identity that is not necessarily known to the other departments. And so through the CRM system that was approved in the previous item, we are implementing functionality that will better able us to manage our communication systems with residents with the Long Beach One card. We would also be giving the residents a portal for easy engagement and connectivity in their hands. This could connect a citywide calendar. When we talk about equity and access, a lot of that conversation falsely gives a representation of a barrier fence in which a tall person can see over the fence. And we have to let the shorter people stand on boxes to see over. I'm saying let's remove the fence. Let's take down the fence. It's the 21st century, and it's time we seek innovative, technology based solutions to make sure all people have equal opportunity for access, not those that know their council offices phone number, not those who know that public works is the one who handles that versus Parks and Rec , whether it's language, access, identification, qualifications, or needed services of housing, public transportation, parking, access to citywide parking lots, access to our our regional park health and senior programing, access to our C one and C two meal programs for seniors, arts and cultural institutions as we. As well as we have the capability to connect everything with banking and payment functions. There should be that same functionality that allows our residents connect easily with us. That's why I'm proposing the Long Beach one card as a solution. As a city, we should strive to get everyone connected. And so with that, I hope that I'll have my colleagues support in finding the next step. Right now, we have several different apps. You have an app to review, a police report, you have an app to do Long Beach Transit. And within Long Beach Transit, you can enroll and reserve your seat to get to and from events. And we should be able to have that same connectivity across our library programs, our park programs. Individuals call my office and say I registered for summer day camp with these deposits and now I have to go somewhere to do something to get my kid enrolled. To be able to move from six weeks of care to seven weeks of care should be easy and convenient for the senior mom, single mom. And so with this, I ask for my colleagues support.\\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Councilmember Mongo. I'll remember. Richard. I'm sorry, Your Honor.\\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. Acting mayor. Normally I'm opposed to any kind of additional ID cards that are going to be given to people to identify themselves where they're at. But I sound down on this and because I think that it's a discussion worth worth having only to so that we could get more information about some of the technology that that we are in the 20th and 21st century. We are looking at more technology as we move forward, and I think that we need to be on top of it. So I'm doing this with a bit of trepidation in thinking this, that I want to see what comes out of it. So before I vote against it, I'm voting for it, but not that I'm going to vote against it at the end. But just giving a preview that in case it comes out to where I'm not totally sure that I want to support something like this. I just want to put it out there that there is some concerns that I might have with this card as it moves forward, especially as it relates to identifying people, residents who perhaps are not fully documented to be here. What would be the requirements to get the card? What types of ID and proof of residency they would have to show? Those types of things. So like I say, I'm checking this with a bit of trepidation, but let's move forward with it. Thank you.\\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Well, if there's no objection, I want to go to public comment and then bring it back line. Will.\\nSpeaker 5: I would love that. Would I be able to make one comment to council member?\\nSpeaker 6: Would your comment hold you hold your comment.\\nSpeaker 4: All right.\\nSpeaker 6: Well, you got me. First, I'd like to call Leslie, then Jessica Quintana.\\nSpeaker 4: Hi. I just wasn't really clear that we actually needed an ID card. I mean, I would think just a password and a name should do it for most things. The other thing that concerned me about this one is that it kind of smacks of Big Brother and a watchful eye of the city that, you know, they're going to keep track of every single thing that you do. And I think that makes people fearful. Um. I wouldn't want to inhibit their participation in anything by them being paranoid that their participation is being tracked. So that's it.\\nSpeaker 6: Thank you for your comments, Mr. Quintana, please.\\nSpeaker 4: Good evening. Jessica Quintana, executive director of Central Asia. As you know, we're a nonprofit organization in the city of Long Beach. And time and time again, we hear from our residents and families and youth that, you know, they need to reduce the amount of paperwork and IDs that they need to go get services within the community. You know, I think this is very innovative. Thank you so much, Councilwoman Mango, for bringing this forward. I think it needs work, you know? Definitely needs to have a good discussion in regards to the community, you know, not being fearing that their identity or their whereabouts are being tracked. We're trying to make this, you know, system very easily for our families and residents to get park recreation services, to be able to go get go to a food bank, to be able to get transportation. So I think there needs to be more thought into this initiative because there's definitely needs to be benefits for a lot of our low income families to be able to access services citywide. So not just in one eastern area, but also on the west side of area in north and south of of Long Beach. And so I think that if we can come up with a system that benefits our community residents to be able to access, you know, things for their families, education services, for the children to go to the library, to be involved in baseball, soccer. You know, one idea that shows that they're qualified, that they're eligible and they can participate. And so I think that that would reduce a lot of, you know, challenges for parents to access, you know, city services, whether that be the arts, culture, you know, recreation, you know, food banks, anything for the city. But I'm telling you at this point, this is very, very infant stage of this. And there needs to be a lot more discussion. I know up in Denver, Colorado, where I'm from, where I was born, because I grew up in Long Beach my whole life. They also have a one ID card. And so folks are able to access the bus system, you know, get library services, get recreation services, go to their local museums for free. So, you know, that's the kind of opportunities that we want to be able to provide our families. So I'm sorry.\\nSpeaker 6: Thank you so much. I think the clerk gave you a little bit more extra time.\\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mr. Clark.\\nSpeaker 6: With that back Councilmember Mongo, you did want.\\nSpeaker 5: To thank you. Yes. So Rusty is the most progressive cities across the country are the ones that are on the cutting edge of this. Oakland, Denver, San Francisco. I did feel that this was in its infancy, though. I have gone out and met with Jessica and one Benitez and others at Liberty City College and Lobby, Unified School District and Long Beach Transit. And I've done a lot of the initial meetings to get feedback on the initial item. I provided 180 days a six month period because I do believe that there is a greater discussion that really needs to be had. We are finding that passwords are actually causing more risk to people's identities than face ID or a thumbprint or something. Especially our senior communities are most vulnerable when they have multiple logins and passwords or a password that has to change. And so we feel as though I'm sorry, the experts have stated that it is better to have like a digital ID card on your phone of some sort that only you have access to with two two factor authentication. With that, it would also be opt in. And to to Jessica's point, a lot of the discussion of why I didn't bring this three months ago, even though it was prepared and we had these meetings so long ago, was because of the fear and discussion around the census. And we just didn't feel it was an appropriate time until that matter was handled. And then we felt like a six month opening to have that dialog would be appropriate so that we can really talk about moving forward in a more collaborative and collective way. I think also six months from now, we'll have made significant progress on the CRM. Significant progress. I see them all in the back. And so once that significant progress has been made, will really be able to better understand the utilization of this. That really is possible. I think of things like discounted swim lessons to be able to say click. Did you know your kid can go to a safety class today to learn how to swim before drownings? To be able to have that kind of push notification and access to individuals who opt in would be great. It also is great when something is going to happen in your community. We spend a considerable amount of money notifying people by mail that they don't open that something near their home is going to change and oftentimes they're not notified till too late. You'd be able to opt in to that. And so the possibilities are endless. And I really appreciate the openness and both by Councilmember Suranga, even with his trepidation and the support of his canton. I thank you.\\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Member Richardson.\\nSpeaker 9: Thank you, Councilman. So supportive of the item. I think giving 180 80 days to evaluate it makes a lot of sense. Couple of things. So I think over the course of so, in most of those cities where they move forward with municipal I.D., there was a process of sort of engaging with communities. And so I want to make sure that that we call out specifically the undocumented community. Latino population, like the leadership, is engaged about making sure that this is something they're seen as a benefit, not a barrier to services. Also, sort of, you know, municipal I.D. has a lot of benefits and opportunities. I think one of the one of the greatest sort of trends is is the full integration of transit. And, you know, like we had a discussion most recently at Skegg about how we make decisions about what vehicle to take. Right now, you can grab you know, you might be able to grab an app, Uber or Lyft, and see how long it takes to, you know, to get from point A to point B or you might grab Lyft at a Lime app and see a scooter or a bike once in the area. Which one takes the most or at least time looks right now is how do we integrate all of that? Right. If you have municipal services and it may include Long Beach Transit, how do you integrate your app? Right. To say, do I prefer to walk? Do I prefer to scooter? I prefer to ride a bike or catch a lift to get where we're going. That's where things are heading. So I think when we think about municipal ID, I think our innovation department should be thinking about more than just identification, but integration of services that makes us helps us to make smarter decisions about emissions, smarter decisions about transportation and more efficient choices. So I'm certainly you know, I'm certainly going to track and sort of engage here. But I just want to be clear that, you know, there will be apprehension on this issue. And so I want to make sure that that is fully vetted out before it returns in 180 days. And I want to make sure that we we really put some real emphasis on transit. I know about tap car, you know, Los Angeles, but here in Long Beach, we're not we're not online in the same way. Even if we get tap cart, our transit agency, our bike share, our mobile, our scooters are all three separate sort of functions led by three different policy agencies, all in the train. Right, three policy agencies. If we want to make a decision about rates, you have to have three different conversations with three different agencies. If you want to talk about efficiencies, senior discounts, youth access, equity, how to distribute around town, right now it's three conversations with three agencies. We should at minimum, as we explore this, be thinking about a JPA or some joint committee among transit agencies to explore this conversation. So there's just a lot of thoughts here. A plan engage. Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo. I look forward to see where this goes.\\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Member Pearce.\\nSpeaker 8: Yes, thank you. I did have a lot of conversations before coming to council tonight on this issue. I think in an ideal world, all of us have talked about wanting to have integration. I think it's wonderful that we have the CRM conversation happening right now, so I'd want to have a couple of questions answered. First, I'd like to understand how it would interface with our CRM system. I'd like to understand what the cost are. I'd like to understand how our other agencies not only I know that there's some issues where we wouldn't be able to have library cards because there's certain information that's privileged information that can't integrate. So really understanding where can we align different areas. There are a couple communities that are vulnerable communities. I know that the council members is saying it's an opt in. I have issues with creating a system that might be privilege for some that other communities fear getting involved with. So I would ask the staff in exploring this, sit down and meet not only with Jessica's organization, but the Long Beach Immigrant Rights Coalition. The Cambodian community is another population and then our senior population. So we have our senior advisory committee commission. I would want to make sure that how are we making sure that our seniors feel comfortable with this? And I think in an ideal world, it sounds great. Recognizing that it's going to take a lot of work to get there and being realistic with that. I see. I think that that's it in our school board. You know, I know that I spoke with our school board member. The represents my area and I know that they had a lot of concerns. And so let's just make sure that as we go through this, we do it kind of slow and with engagement from all stakeholders. So thank you.\\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Councilmember Mongo.\\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. I appreciate the comments of my colleague. And I'll also add, and I alluded to this a few weeks ago when we were hearing the discussions at the state level related to banking changes and local banks. And so I think that I mean. We talk about some of our Section eight renters, and they don't even have a bank account sometimes. And they they live at cash advance check facilities that cash their checks and pay those amounts. I mean, long term, it could be even bigger than that. And I'm not I'm not going to add the banking in today, but I think that it's important to have the conversations with that in mind in providing that kind of financial access to some of our low income and most in need communities.\\nSpeaker 6: Thank you very much. Hearing no more comment from the behind the wheel. Thank you for the very innovative and thoughtful item this evening and I'm sure we'll be having plenty of discussion on this in the future. Members, please cast your votes.\\nSpeaker 0: Ocean carrying.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"gemini/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20 Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.04251821701080349,\n        \"min\": 0.8398,\n        \"max\": 0.9726,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9016,\n          0.8813,\n          0.9492\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"gemini/gemini-1.5-flash Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.15385737840249614,\n        \"min\": 0.5226,\n        \"max\": 0.9457,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8926,\n          0.5226,\n          0.9057\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

CNN Councilwoman Pryce.\\nSpeaker 4: I.\\nSpeaker 7: First item I know there was this issue was brought to the parking commission and there was some concern. So could you maybe talk through why this increase is being proposed?\\nSpeaker 4: Councilmember Price Yes, good evening. And I'm going to ask Eric Romero, our business development.\\nSpeaker 5: Coordinator who works with the Parking Commission, to talk a little bit about the need for this.\\nSpeaker 4: Assessment. And we.\\nSpeaker 5: Also have our treasurer, David Nakamoto, who's here with us tonight as well with regard to the establishment and administration.\\nSpeaker 4: At the CFTC. Good evening, Mayor, and.\\nSpeaker 3: Members of the city council. My name is Eric Romero. And so, yes, we've the rate for the CFD has been set at about $0.12 per commercial square.\\nSpeaker 5: Foot since.\\nSpeaker 3: 2006.\\nSpeaker 5: And.\\nSpeaker 3: Mainly due to the increase of the the cost.\\nSpeaker 4: Associated with.\\nSpeaker 5: Administrating the different payments associated with paying down the bond and also the increase in the debt.\\nSpeaker 3: Annual payments. We're recommending an increase to that to the rate, which is the.\\nSpeaker 5: First increase in.\\nSpeaker 3: About 12 years.\\nSpeaker 5: And if there's anything else that you would.\\nSpeaker 3: Like to add, Treasurer.\\nSpeaker 4: That.\\nSpeaker 7: Okay. Are there any have there been any concerns on your end in terms of people not paying? And is this is this what we've referred to as the salaries?\\nSpeaker 4: Yes, it is.\\nSpeaker 7: So are there some concerns with people not paying the lowest tax?\\nSpeaker 4: So we.\\nSpeaker 3: Pose that question to the consultant that we work with to pay down the.\\nSpeaker 5: Debt service.\\nSpeaker 3: And as of.\\nSpeaker 5: Today, there are only delinquent installments related to the 20 1718 billing and.\\nSpeaker 3: Only represent about 8.63%.\\nSpeaker 5: Of the 20 1718 billing. So there are no delinquencies for any prior fiscal year. Delinquencies in this district are considered to be low historically, and they generally do not last longer than one year.\\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\\nSpeaker 7: How are we going to ensure moving forward that we're capturing all the payments and that the the property owners who are paying their assessments in a timely fashion are not shouldering the burden of those who aren't fulfilling their own self-assessment obligations.\\nSpeaker 3: The county treasurer and tax collector.\\nSpeaker 5: Sent out delinquency notices just before the end of the fiscal year to notify the delinquent property owners that their delinquencies will become.\\nSpeaker 3: Defaulted on July one.

We typically wait for delinquencies to be substantial before moving towards foreclosure, and that.\\nSpeaker 3: Process.\\nSpeaker 5: Involves fees for our consultant.\\nSpeaker 3: Members.\\nSpeaker 5: The county and a foreclosure attorney.\\nSpeaker 7: Have we done any sort of analysis of the standard property size on these assessments to determine what the monetary impact of. A The increase would be the .03 cents. Do we know how much more it would be to a standard property there? Their annual assessment. The range may be.\\nSpeaker 12: Councilmember Price I'd like to field that question. When the community facilities district was formed. It was by the vote of the property owners. And at that time, they they voted to self-assess themselves. An engineering report was prepared at that time that allowed for a maximum of $0.66 per square foot. We are far from that level at this point.\\nSpeaker 7: Okay, great. Thank you. I appreciate that. It was my goal to get you to talk at a council meeting. So there we go. Congratulations.

The committee recommends the resolution be adopted.\\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Mosquito.\\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mr. President. As I described this morning in council briefing, we have an opportunity to advance a resolution today that is really about an international treaty. I handed out a central staff memo from Eric McConaughey. Thank you again for providing that comprehensive analysis for our full committee partner or county council partners. Just very briefly, this is regarding the Skagit Environmental Endowment Commission or the CBC, which was established as part of the Ross Lake Seven Mile Reservoir Treaty, signed in 1984 between British Columbia and the city of Seattle. The SCC is made up of eight commissioners appointed by the Mayor of Seattle and eight appointed by the premier of British Columbia. The SEC's mission is the preservation and protection of natural and cultural resources and recreational opportunities of the Upper Skagit watershed through advocacy, international cooperation and strategic partnerships. Again, I want to thank my committee colleagues, Councilmember Suarez and Councilmember Bagshaw, for raising the question specifically about tribal relations and more importantly, tribal representation on this important board, which we're going to get more information about, I believe. The CDC administers the Skagit Environmental Endowment Fund Compromise of International I'm sorry, a compromise of initial contributions from Seattle and B.C. of 4,000,001 million, respectively, and annual supplemental payments from both parties based on power sales. The CSA prepares a budget on a five year cycle, which requires approval by the B.C. government and the city of Seattle. Finally, the CDC funds projects ranging from recreational enhancement to educational and ecosystem science. That's what we're funding today. And we will be getting more information to compare the projected five year budget going forward with what was expended in the last five years, which will be critical to help answer the questions that the Council currently has. Thanks so much for the approval of the Budget and 2015 to 2018 via resolution 31568 in 2015. This resolution approves the 2019 2013 budget and we recommend it for the full council passage.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Get any questions or comments?

        "Speaker 1: Agenda Item nine Council Bill 118470. Relating to land used in zoning. Amending the Seattle Comprehensive Plan to reflect changes to the university community, urban center goals and policies, as well as the future land use map as part of the Periodic Review and to incorporate changes proposed as part of the 2014 2015 Comprehensive Plan Annual Amendment Process. The committee recommends the bill passed as amended.\n",
        "Speaker 0: And there's a divided report on this legislation. So we'll begin with the majority report. Council member O'BRIEN Thank you.\n",
        "Speaker 4: So the probably clearest way for folks to track this is to look at the attachment attachment one amendment to the future land use map. And that should give you an overview with the little bubbles that explain all the different changes in the map, where the changes are being proposed in the legislation as it came out of committee . This series of changes is all in anticipation of a neighborhood rezone that we're anticipate receiving from Department of Planning and Development sometime in 2016. It's something that's been discussed for a number of years. For a while, it was anticipated in 2015, but we expect to get that next year. And these are the future land use map changes that would accommodate the range of changes that will be be proposed in that in that rezone. Normally, we might take these concurrently. We know we traditionally do the comprehensive plan changes in March, but because next year we're doing comprehensive plan changes as part of Seattle 2035, and there's going to be a longer process. I anticipate that those changes won't come until much later in the year. And if we don't do these now, that would inhibit our ability to do the university rezone until after that was done, which likely would be too late in the year. Specifically in committee, there are a couple of differences. All that Councilmember Lucado speak to his alternative, but there are a couple of changes that we heard some concerns about. We discussed those. And Councilmember Burgess and I felt felt strongly that the proposal from DPD was solid.\n",
        "Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Licata. I will be voting against this legislation because I well, I do recognize that there was a lot of participation by community members as well as our staff over a period of a one or one or two years. Nevertheless, there was a great deal of opposition still remaining in that neighborhood from the community council and particularly from folks in the residential areas that were included in the areas that are proposed for changes. The there was some compromises made in reducing the area. However, people living in that community felt that it did not go far enough. And they're concerned that the nature of the university district will dramatically change, particularly since this will open the door for increased uptake of zoning and therefore probably what they call the towers that will change the. I think the quality and I think the quality of living as far as casting large shadows, increasing of traffic and make it more difficult to provide even more open space in an area that does not have that much open space. They had asked that more time be used to take a look at those concerns. They felt that in particular the community council was not involved enough and that they are concerned about the University Community Urban Center potentially being impacted. So there'd be an increase in displaced residents from the existing available affordable housing as it was torn down for new development and without a plan to see how those individuals would be housed in the future so they could still have access to university without having to move further and further away and therefore contributing to the overall congestion in the university district. That is, plan should at this time be on hold. So I support their efforts on that. Thank you. Any other comments or questions, Councilmember Rasmussen?\n",
        "Speaker 4: Thank you. I would like to hear from the majority of the committee how their response to the concerns that Councilmember Lakota raised about what I would describe as loss of neighborhood character, displacement of affordable housing, and what we see now, if you go to the university district, an incredible homogenization of what is a very eclectic community, both with regard to the type of housing income levels who are able to live there are in cultural organizations, longstanding community organizations as well. So this is what I think Councilmember Lakota, you've expressed concern about. And if that is true, then how how can we prevent those risks and those losses from occurring if this legislation goes forward? Is this the last opportunity to prevent those kind of losses? But anyway, I would love to hear from the majority their response to Councilmember Carter's concerns. Councilmember O'BRIEN So the I think a lot of the concerns that Councilmember Alucarda raised. Are probably more directed towards what will likely be part of a discussion around the actual reason for the university district. The you know, if you look at the map on attachment one, the specific changes we're making on this amendment to the comprehensive plan are relatively modest. There were some concerns about in some of the pockets of the neighborhoods where they would be. There's nothing specifically about these amendments that I mean, even without these amendments, there's lots of areas that could be considered for zones and towers throughout throughout the university district. But where and how we do that will be determined in that process, which is to come in 2016. I can speak specifically to, you know, within the urban village there is no single family zoning. It's all multifamily and commercial. There's a couple tiny pockets where we've expanded the urban village. One is around a church that wants to be able to add more ADA accessible accessibility from a parking lot. But they're not allowed to do that because it's in a single family zone. I didn't hear any opposition to that change. There's also a small piece of single family that's going to be incorporated now along Ravenna, and it's going to be turned into commercial mixed use. Again, I had I didn't hear any I don't recall hearing specific concerns about that. There were some folks that wanted to see some area taken out of the urban village. And we took a little bit out and they asked to take more out. And there's an area that is where there currently is a tower that's currently zoned multi-family residential. And the map would allow that to be multi-family, residential or commercial mixed use like an some Seattle mixed zone.\n",
