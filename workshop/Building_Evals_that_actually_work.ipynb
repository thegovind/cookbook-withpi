Communication from City Auditor Recommendation to receive and file the summary report on Proposition H for fiscal year 27 through 2013 code.\\nSpeaker 1: It has been in motion and in the second. And with that, I'm going to turn this over to our city auditor, who is going to make some comments on the on the audit and her work on that.\\nSpeaker 0: So thank you very much. Appreciate your time tonight. I just have a brief summary report to report to you this evening. I really appreciate your discussion earlier on the importance of public safety. This was a measure that was I have a little PowerPoint, I'll be moving along, but it wasn't supposed to be like little keyboard here.\\nSpeaker 1: Madam Clerk, is there something for the auditor there?\\nSpeaker 0: Okay. This was a measure that was passed in 2027. Four. For those of you that weren't here, maybe I can just give a little brief history. One of the first audits our office did was to review the oil production tax in Long Beach and doesn't really seem to be working. Okay. There we go. Thank you. And we found that the oil production tax was first established in 1990 here in Long Beach at $0.15 a barrel. When we reviewed it compared to other neighboring cities, we found that Long Beach was the lowest out of all the taxes. So we recommended to the council that it be increased by $0.25 per barrel to bring it in line with the neighboring cities. We collaborated with the council, with the mayor, with the oil production companies, and they agreed that $0.40 was fair and equitable. The council put that $0.25 increase on the ballot and allocated that to public safety. So I'm here tonight because seven years later we have information and data to show that this has been a consistent and reliable revenue stream and has benefited public safety greatly in the city of Long Beach. It was it was an overwhelming success as far as the vote. Over 70% of the vote of the people, the first time in the history of Long Beach that the tax increase had passed. And to report to you over the past seven years, the city of Long Beach has brought in $22 million through this oil production tax . It has spent $19 million on personnel staffing, 12 police officers, 11 firefighters over the past seven years to improve and strengthen public safety throughout the city. The additional $2.8 million was spent on fire, truck acquisition, retrofit technology uniforms and other safety needs. And the ordinance also required our office to perform an annual financial audit to ensure that the city is in fact receiving and collecting all the revenue due from the oil producers and that the money is spent as intended according to the code. So our office has agenda is that item for the September 16th consent calendar. I'll be happy to answer to any questions at this time. But I did want to just briefly report tonight that this is a really positive revenue stream for the city, and it has produced $3.5 million annually for public safety specifically. And I really want to thank the mayor and the City Council for their collaboration and for what a great benefit this is tangible benefits for our community in strengthening public safety, as well as thanking the police chief and the fire chief for identifying the most beneficial ways of protecting our city by our use of this money. So that's my.\\nSpeaker 1: Report. Thank you. And thank you. I'll just let me just add briefly, just I know they speak for most just thank you for all your hard work on on all the issues, particularly this one. I think you've done a great job and it was widely written about in the press, which I know we all have had a chance to read. It was great to see that, you know, that your work and the work of the council got the type of real good, thoughtful coverage that it did. Councilmember Andrews.\\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Thank you, Mayor. I truly want to thank our city auntie, Mrs. Laura Dowd, you and her staff for that very, you know, informative report on Prop eight. You know what? While while I do appreciate the carryover funds and the interests that it attracts, I want to make sure that we are all supplying the police and the fire department with all the tools they need to continue to keep our city and street safe. And thank you very much, Mrs. Dowd.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Richardson.\\nSpeaker 4: I also wanted to chime in and just say great work and thank you for showing this data. I think it really builds good faith with the voters to show that when they step out and make investments in our city, we do track it and we spend it the right way appropriately to provide the services that are much needed and they count on. So thank you for providing that transparency.\\nSpeaker 8: Thank you.\\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember O'Donnell.\\nSpeaker 2: I just want to acknowledge the work of Brian Meneghini, my chief of staff, who actually led the ground effort on this campaign to get this passed. So that was how it was a collaboration, like you mentioned for sure. I just want to acknowledge him. Thank you. The people.\\nSpeaker 4: Who actually run the campaign and do the do the.\\nSpeaker 2: Groundwork don't often get acknowledged. So congratulations to him for helping get this passed as well. Thank you.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\\nSpeaker 1: Councilmember Ringa.\\nSpeaker 9: I'm not sure if this update comes every year, but it certainly explains a lot of things for me in regards to how our moneys are spent with with the transfer of funds that go to it to to provide additional officers where police departments. I want to thank you for that as well.\\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. Thank you.\\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And we have a motion on the floor if there's any public comment on the item. See none. Thanks again for the report. Members, please cast your vote.\\nSpeaker 2: I think.\\nSpeaker 0: Councilman Richardson. Motion carries nine zero.\\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you. Now we're going to be going back to 1.15, which is it turned back to Vice Mayor Lowenthal, which is the first of the two final votes. And I believe that everyone has the recommendations as amended.\",\n          \"Speaker 1: It's motion carries.\\nSpeaker 0: Great.

District two.\\nSpeaker 0: Councilman Price.\\nSpeaker 5: I just want to make sure that what we talked about the last time this issue was brought to council still remains true. And that is that no projects that are currently planned in the Tidelands area specific to Council District three would be impacted as a result of any risk associated with this item.\\nSpeaker 0: Mayor Councilmembers I'm going to turn.\\nSpeaker 7: That over to our city treasurer, David.\\nSpeaker 0: Nakamoto.\\nSpeaker 4: Thank you very much, Madam Councilman.

Thank you, Miss Butler. It's always nice to get fans we weren't anticipating. And that's what we have here. And thank you for your report. And Madam Kirk, do we have public speakers on this item?\\nSpeaker 0: We do not. Okay.\\nSpeaker 1: Well, counsel, it's if we have no public speakers, then I'm going to go ahead. They're going to go ahead and close public comment and we will just launch right into council questions, comments, motion, what have you. So Council, what's your pleasure, Councilmember Herrera Spencer and then Councilmember Knox.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mayor, and thank you, Jack, for this report. I'd like some more information about the all of these items. How, for instance, how did you come up with the ratio? Is there some formula that the reference of the 125,000, if I heard correctly, and I read this correctly, it's ten persons, but I don't know for how many nights. And I'd like to actually know what is the cost per night that you're estimating. And then the second one, the Street Outreach, Mental Health. Do we have an organization right now that you're working with that you're extending what is the 75,000 buy and then the last digit, the amount that.\\nSpeaker 1: 85,000.\\nSpeaker 0: Is actually the most broad. That could actually be my preference. And I don't know if you could allocate more money to that. I really like the idea of that includes assistance for car repairs, paying back rent and utilities for previously homeless or those most vulnerable are on the verge of becoming homeless. And this to me is actually, if I'm understanding correctly, is the most similar to some sort of universal basic income where we help, we treat people that they know that they how to spend the money work best and can get the most bang out of it. And I think that that might actually be my highest priority is where I think it could be most efficient. But so I would like more information of, you know, what is the cost per night for the overnight shelter. I think maybe some people can figure it out, maybe lower if we give them more money to spend. Thanks. Okay. So I don't have the cost per night, but I could probably calculate it. I would need to go through my notes for that. What I do, what I do have is that. And the way we the way that it was figured out was we were trying to have a stopgap measure for a for for shelter. We need a way to put people in shelter temporarily. It cost about $100 per night to have people in in shelter temporarily. And this would allow us to get some of the most vulnerable off the street. People say that they don't have a place to stay at all, and that's why they're setting up camp in our city. We would be able to move them temporarily to a shelter. So I will I will come back to that item. As far as as the other items are concerned, mental health, we do have a provider that we're working with that that does provide mental health services that could tack on to what they are providing. We have not negotiated a deal with them, but we we have talked I have talked to them about perhaps having them work with some of our moderate and extreme mental health folks that that that we have in and that are homeless in Alameda that were trying to get in into permanent housing. But we can't do that because their health condition is such that they can't be trusted in housing at this point. And then with the flexible funds, the amount was based on being able to provide the temporary shelter and the mental health service, and that was the remaining amount. So I will get back to you on the the shelter item. Okay. You have to do a calculation.\\nSpeaker 1: And Councilmember Harris, as you had more questions.\\nSpeaker 0: So I would like to know who that provider is that you're looking that's currently working with the city that you're looking at extending. Um, the, the shelter, the, the case provider would be Operation Dignity. Thank you.\\nSpeaker 1: I had a question having to do with mental health assistance, Mr. Butler. Is it possible if we were to augment the amount we're spending on those services now, that we could have someone on call 24 seven for somebody who's just having an episode and looks like they could use some assistance, as.\\nSpeaker 0: Does.\\nSpeaker 1: Operation Dignity. I think they do outreach. Outreach, correct. And what you know, what are their what are their what's their structure now? Is it Monday through Friday certain hours? Is it on the weekend?\\nSpeaker 0: No, it's not on the weekend. It's Monday through Friday. Mm hmm.\\nSpeaker 1: So would there be a possibility of extending to the weekends and maybe the evenings?\\nSpeaker 0: We could look at doing that with the dollars instead of doing the mental health piece. Are you? Are you? We don't have them doing any mental health. Okay.\\nSpeaker 1: I was confused when you said Operation Dignity. I was. Yeah. So who who would be providing the mental health services?\\nSpeaker 0: What I would be proposing is operation. Technically, they provide it in other jurisdictions within hours. Got it.\\nSpeaker 1: Do we not currently provide some mental health assistance to our homeless population?\\nSpeaker 0: No, we only provide case management. Hmm.\\nSpeaker 1: Got it. Okay, so this would actually be something new. We're starting. Okay. Okay. Okay. Well, then I could see the I could see the the reasoning for starting with a monday through Friday model. But hopefully, perhaps if it's successful, it could be expanded to to longer, because I think we could probably all agree that people that just have their mental health crises Monday through Friday. Okay, I, I have some other thoughts, but I'd love to hear from the rest of the council council members. Anybody want to add anything or to be like these recommendations? Council member, not quite when it was.\\nSpeaker 2: Ready to move the staff recommendation. I think they did a great job and I just want to thank them for their work. They moved the staff recommendation. Okay.\\nSpeaker 1: And did. Okay. Let's have a say and then maybe have a just a little bit more discussion. Council member, they said, are you seconding? Okay, perfect. We've had a motion by council member that's. Wait a second. By councilor would decide the. I just wanted to. I love everything you proposed. Ms.. Butler and then on the page three where it says if well, it's a carryover from page two, if other funding is sufficient to address the mental illness needs of the city's housed staff recommends that the proposed mental health funding referenced above be divided between and allocated to the other two categories, that being increasing the 67,000 plus fortnightly shelter to 185,000 plus, and then increasing the flexible funds from 14,000 some to 100,000. Alternatively, the funds could be used for transitional housing programs such as the community cabins. I might like to see some of that money going to try to help get those shelters where people could go. That I do think more than 14,000 for flexible funds is a good thing and jumping it all the way up to 100,000. That's quite a bit. And again, this is only if we find that there's funding coming in to cover the mental health services that Ms.. Butler's proposing. But I. Anybody else have any thoughts about that? Ms.. Butler ahead.\\nSpeaker 0: I should say that this cut, the funding cut, can span over a couple of years. It's not just a one year funding amount. And so the the moneys for the flexible funds, which just extend for a longer period of time. Okay. Okay.\\nSpeaker 1: I thank you for that clarification. What period of time are we talking about?\\nSpeaker 0: Currently the funding would probably last about a year, just over a year and a half. And if you extended it, it would last approximately two years. Okay.\\nSpeaker 1: Thank you for that clarification. Okay. Councilmember Herrera Spencer.\\nSpeaker 0: Q In regards to mental health services, I don't know if we've looked in at Almeida Family Services, and I know they provide quite a bit of mental health support to other APEC, I believe, as well as our schools. And obviously within the community they offer quite a bit of counseling. So I don't know if you checked with them, if they would be eligible to help with any of your ideas. But I, we we could we could extend it. We could do an RFP for these services. We don't have to go with the entity that I spoke with. It was just that I spoke with them because they do provide it in other locations. It's my understanding when analysts here she had spoken to Alameda Family Services in the past for services and they they are interested in providing services but maybe not of this type. I can go back to them and speak with them about that again. And then APEC, I was not aware that they provided mental health services, so I can also speak with them. Family Services at least provide some mental health services to APC. Sorry if I misspoke. Okay. I really value our services of the different locations within the community already. And I and I this my understanding that they have the capability to do the Weekender 24 seven services. Well, I can I can definitely speak with them. So just this is, you know, something to look into. But regardless of the formula, how is it the bet is that this.\\nSpeaker 1: This allocation.\\nSpeaker 0: Really the best use of.\\nSpeaker 1: The money?\\nSpeaker 0: I'm not really sure because I'm not really sure what it's based on. But I, I do like with, you know, flexible funds and letting it can go to a lot of different options. So I just think that so when you're saying the one 2575 and then the 86, is that like at some point it means the city gets these means that they could reallocate depending upon what things actually cost and where we actually see the greater need to meet people's needs. Yes. So to answer your first question about the the cost, it would be $1,250 a week, and that would be five, five days a week. Just $50 plus the weekends. So it would be seven days a week. And then your second question. I'm sorry, I was doing the calculation to try to get you your information. What was the second question going back to the first one then? Is it how many days does. Over a year? It's over a year, 50 to 52 days and ten people. And it's $1,250 a week. Okay. So depending upon if that really is the best uses the program unfolds, I'd like to hope that we can have some flexibility there because I think keeping people in their homes might actually be a good use of that tool, which is the flexibility issue option.\\nSpeaker 1: Anything for the second baseman, Avila. Okay. Vice mayor of L.A..\\nSpeaker 0: It just we know that our unhoused population has grown. We have a significant need with the folks that are going to our shelter. We also know that they do not have a place to go at night. And I think that this is a good opportunity. I think that what we are going to find is that this is insufficient to serve. That need is substantially insufficient. This is not a huge amount of money that we're talking about. I'm very supportive of the staff recommendation. I think it is trying to maximize the space that we have at our data center while still addressing with dignity the needs of the folks that we have. So I'm prepared to support the proposal tonight. And I also just think that at the end of the day, I also want to be cognizant of staff time. We are having this staff work on a number of different issues. And so I actually don't support having them try to go back and kind of do work a second time. We keep bringing up Alameda Point or we keep bringing up different vendors relative to the mental health services. We have vendors that are already operating in this space and so are providers, I should say. And I think that we need to honor the work that's been done rather than second guessing it and, you know, move forward with this. I think there's going to be other opportunities. This is not something where I think that, you know, an RFP or anything like that is needed. I think it would actually delay providing these services that are very, very much needed. That's all.\\nSpeaker 1: I would say I agree with that approach. Anyone else want to add anything before we vote on approving the staff proposal? Remind me. We had a motion by Council member Knox White and it was seconded right. By former SA. Correct.\\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\\nSpeaker 1: All right, then. Well, let's take a roll call vote, if we could, please. Madam Clerk.\\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember de SAG. Yes. Herrera. Spencer, I.\\nSpeaker 2: Knox Light. Hi.\\nSpeaker 0: Fella. I mayor as Ashcraft high.\\nSpeaker 1: That carries by five eyes. Great. Thank you. And Ms.. Butler, thank you again for all your hard work in following up on this. It is so important we have not had a place in Alameda where every day of the year there is someplace that an and sheltered person could lay down their head and have a roof over their head. And so now this is an important first step toward doing that. So thank you so much for all your hard work and we'll look forward to hearing more from you.\\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\\nSpeaker 1: All right. So with that, we're going to close. I turn six B and we're moving on to item 60. Madam Kirk, will you introduce that item for us, please?\\nSpeaker 0: Recommendation to assign a portion of the 28.68 million funding from the federal government through the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to assist this recovery from the impacts of the COVID 19 pandemic.\\nSpeaker 1: Right. Who doesn't like talking about money coming into the city, huh? And I see some familiar financial faces. We have our finance director and Anita, we have Jennifer, 12, also from finance. And I think. Do you ladies have a presentation? I believe you've got a PowerPoint. Is that you, city manager?\\nSpeaker 2: No, I think. Mr. Bowden, are you. Oh, I'm so sorry. Yeah, I'm going to try. I'm going to do the presentation, but these folks are critical to the conversation. So we'll tag team the responses and Q&A segment. All right. Thank you. Good evening.\\nSpeaker 1: Anyway.\\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much. Council members, we have another update for you on the the American Rescue Plan Act funding. We hope that the conversation tonight starts to start to funnel our our priorities into a particular direction. Next slide, please. And thank you. So as you all know, we've got $28.68 million in ARPA funding coming to the city of Alameda on June 17th. We received our first tranche, which is a $14.34 million, and we had City Council direction on this topic back in May. There were a couple of themes to the meeting in May. One of the things that we took away from that meeting was setting up a framework for us to be able to allocate these funds. So we did set up some guiding principles for council's consideration this evening. We also distilled down the topic from the main meeting into four topic areas supplementing revenue loss. This is general fund revenue. Loss was one of the topic areas. Addressing housing, homelessness and behavioral health matters was another topic area building broadband infrastructure in the community and really investing in that in that key and really underinvested in piece of infrastructure in the community was another topic area that came to light. And then finally the household and local small business assistance programing, which which is essentially a bucket at this point. There is no program designed around this like we had with prior funding sources. First, with respect to COVID, COVID response and recovery, the monies are intended to be a response to COVID. So that is a critical, critical theme, underlying theme that needs to be considered throughout the discussion. Next slide. So these are the guiding principles. There are eight of them on the screen. The ones that I guess all I'll I'll call out this this information is all fleshed out a little further in the staff report. But we did want to make sure that we called out the equity lens as a particular item that we're wanted to emphasize with the ARPA dollars. This is a response to COVID. And COVID did impact certain certain elements in our community, certain folks in our community, more so than others. And so as we look to funding opportunities, this is a way to to ensure that we are spreading those resources a little more generously to areas that were harder hit by the pandemic and the impacts also that the general fund has taken a hit during COVID, and we did bring in less revenue. And so the idea of being able to top up the general fund, which does provide services across the community, is is a topic area that we wanted to make sure was in there. And finally, the one time expenditures element was a theme that we pulled out as well from the the main the main discussion. This is this is one time money. So anything that we create that creates an ongoing operational cost is going to be something that the city's general fund or other funding sources would have to absorb. So with that, we'll say next slide, please, and thank you. The interim final rule is really what guides the the elements that are eligible for the that the spending. There are there are some pretty big buckets there. We did using the interim final rule, using the the guiding principles, using the city council priorities that had been established\",\n          \"Speaker 2: Motion carries, we'll.\\nSpeaker 1: Go to 14, then back to 13.\\nSpeaker 2: Report from City Clerk recommendation to execute all necessary documents to receive and extend grant funding awarded to the Office of the City Clerk by City Fabric as part of the night city's challenge for the place. Make the vote. Put our engagement initiative in the amount not to exceed $30,000 citywide.\\nSpeaker 0: You.\\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to turn this over to the clerk, I believe. Right. And then you can introduce Sheila Swirsky.\\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Thank you, Mayor. So I want to just say thank you to Citi Fabric for engaging my office and the city of Long Beach in this great initiative. And I will reserve the majority of my comments until after Brian gives his presentation to let you know about what place make the vote is and how the initiative is going to impact our great city here in Long Beach. So, Brian, if you could come up to the podium.\\nSpeaker 7: Great things. Honorable Mayor and city council. Thank you for having me this evening to share some excitement, exciting work that we're doing with the city clerk's office, the county registrar, and some of our community partners, including Long Beach Rising. We were fortunate enough this past year to be the second recipient of a Night City's Challenge Award. Long Beach, the city of Long Beach, obviously getting the other one for the outdoor office space. The idea that we had four place make the vote was to use people use placemaking as a way to expand voter engagement and hopefully get voters to linger with their fellow residents and hopefully spark the synapses within the community to continue being civically engaged within their neighborhood. So I'll just give a brief presentation and a little bit of overview of the project. But also we had a prototype this past June election and we can share a little bit of that. So the project background place Make the Vote PMT is a toolkit that helps expansive engagement encourage voting using pop up social spaces around bowling our polling booth locations. And this is a process that we had initiated when we had the proposal last year. It's a little out of order. We actually had the grant awarded after our primary prototype, but our partners were willing to come together even before the contract and grant check were signed. So I appreciate everybody what we're going to do. We had one prototype site for the June election in the second District. Congratulations, Councilmember Pierce at the Fourth Street Senior Center. And the idea is we're going to expand to have four sites during the general election in November, and we're going to also do some voter engagement drives between when the ballot is set and the election. Then we will also do some vote by mail event at those four sites before the November election. And so our partners I mentioned before Long Beach rising ourselves, city fabric, the Long Beach City Clerk's Office, the county registrar. And we're actually very fortunate enough to have had some help from Parks and Rec at our fourth Street Senior Center site. And Public Works really did come through for us on some last minute assistance to make some better spaces on our street. So there's the overall branding of the place make the vote. We want to do something fun, but yet still patriotic. And we expanded the voting for vote. And so we expanded upon that, doing some fun ideas around graphics, posters. And really the idea behind this kit is that while we are going to activate four sites directly, we are also building a kit, a website material that can be printed, downloaded online, also ordered through manufacturers and fabricators that people can actually do place make the vote not just on those four sites, but any sites in Long Beach , any sites in California, even in Ohio. Florida really trying to make this a grassroots initiative where people are throwing block parties and trying to get their residents, their fellow neighbors, to participate in the voting process, but also be part of the civic engagement that takes place beyond. And so I was mentioning in June we had our prototype. It was at the Fourth Street Senior Center. It was a great location, a lot of foot traffic. We introduced a parklet along Fourth Street to really kind of grab attention. We had a lot of graphics for banners and posters and seating had food. We were fortunate actually. We also had Health and Human Services partake in this program. They had a healthy, active Long Beach, had a health food demonstration. So it was really nice that we were able to bring in a lot of partners from the city. And, you know, we had seating, we had games, we had some customized flags made and big six foot V for vote symbols. We also had a photo booth, which was probably the most popular part. We had a lot of people of all sorts of backgrounds participating and doing fun stuff with various bowlers and wigs and glasses and definitely something that we will take back and definitely use on future plays. Make the both sides. And part of the idea with the prototype was to test out some initial ideas before we go out and foresight before we build this toolkit that others can use. We did user intercepts, we asked residents, we asked voters. We got a lot of really fun feedback about wanting to participate in this process and wanting every polling site to be this way. We also had a lot of good press coverage locally as well as nationally Smithsonian, CNN, NPR, but also Long Beach Post, Signal Hill, L.A. A lot of really people perking up. We've even had some other foundations take a page from what we were doing the and doing this in L.A. at other sites. And we also had a lot. Lessons learned as part of this idea of prototyping. How do we evolve this to be something that can be successful on a larger format? And how could this be expanded to be something that other people can take advantage of? And so we did Pro Tips based on interviews with our city clerk's staff through the county register. Our polling workers are participants, and we're also still looking at some of the data from this prototype to see if we were able to make any sort of significant impact. It is within the what was taking place across city. We saw voter participation generally increase. One thing that we did notice a significant increase on was provisional balloting spiked at one of the two precincts here. It was actually highest in the city. So that was something that we could really point to as success. We definitely saw people walking up and asking, Hey, can I vote here? I live in North Long Beach or I live in Santa monica even. And so we did see a receptive voter audience that just saw it and wanted to participate. And so those are things that we'll try to adapt and incorporate going forward. And, you know, Next Steps is looking at those four sites that we're going to program, moving this voter education program forward and then looking at the kit that we're going to release online in the next month or so for others that take advantage. So this is a really exciting opportunity. I mean, we're very fortunate to have the city clerk's office participating as well as a number of other departments. Everybody has been very open minded. This is a great opportunity to try to you know, there's rock the vote, there's vote, turbo vote. There's all sorts of different voter initiatives. There's something that's very localized, something that can be very grassroots. So we see a lot of opportunity for this proceeding forward. I'm here for any questions or comments.\\nSpeaker 2: And I just want to add that this this project is very dynamic because it targets and aims its efforts at the lowest voter participation rates in the city. So we're really focused on getting those neighborhoods that are not engaged in voting or in the democratic process and getting them activated in and create a culture of civic participation in those neighborhoods. So we're really excited to to be part of that effort. And thank you, Brian, for engaging our office in in that project as well also.\\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next up, council member Pierce.\\nSpeaker 10: Thank you, Brian, very much for your vision and thinking outside the box. I really was excited to see this on Tuesday morning, especially because I was in my district at the senior center, as you mentioned, and just want to say thank you for doing a good job of partnering with folks that are doing civic engagement. I think partnering with an organization like yours that has the ability to think outside the box. Talk about branding. Talk about messaging. You've always been great at that and partnering that with people that are on the ground, knocking on doors, trying to get canvasing. Yeah. Doing the propensity voter turnout, you know. And so, you know, as you guys are doing the next four, it's exciting to see that those are going to be in the lowest voter precincts turn out. And I would just encourage you guys to partner again with Long Beach rising to do the the walk pieces so that they can also encourage people to go out.\\nSpeaker 7: Yeah, they're an official partner as part of this this grant. And so we're very fortunate to have them with the boots on the ground. And so we've got a number of other partners also coming forward really excited about this. So I think, you know, this idea is worth pursuing in a lot of different ways.\\nSpeaker 10: Yeah, definitely. And I think, you know, it's a very proud moment to see you guys partnering with Long Beach Rising, an organization that I helped, you know, back in 2010 started. It was a sad year for me to not play any role in working with them. So and then just I would love to hear how you're partnering with, you know, if we're doing something in the sixth District or are you working with organizations there and how we're partnering with organizations based locally. So. Great job. Congratulations.\\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo.\\nSpeaker 2: I've always been a person who talks a lot about why voting matters, and many have heard me talk a little bit about how we can continue to get people out to vote. And we also need to engage those communities in a long term strategy about cleaning our voter roll because we have an artificially low voter turnout when hundreds of people who've moved and or passed away are still on the voter roll. And it makes it look like we have less civic engagement than we really have. I think a great example of that is there's a precinct in Long Beach where there had been the same poll worker for 35 years and she took personal responsibility to work with the city I'm sorry, the county registrar and send in letters every time a neighbor would pass away. And their voter list is remarkable. She's 93 now and I'd be happy to meet with you and talk about it. But her polling place about three years ago hosted a lemonade stand, morning coffee and donuts. And to this day, that polling place is still one of the highest voter turnout to the whole city, and that does not exist anymore. But that sense of community that she built over 30 years. Her name is Lou. She's amazing woman served our country as one of the first women in the Navy. It sticks with that community today. So what you're doing is meaningful and powerful and the fact that you're providing the tools for it to be carried on past a single person is remarkable because Lou won't be with us forever. But if those tools were available, it'd be a lot easier to get a neighborhood leader to step up. So I'd love to work with you on getting information into the communities through the neighborhood night out, which is always in August. So it's really a good lead time for a community to say, We just had a great time. We're taking community watch and taking care of our neighbors seriously and we have a good lead time before the election. Let's let's place make our local polling place. So thank you for applying. Thank you for taking a small idea and making it a national standard.\\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. These are actually really, really fantastic.\\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson.\\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I just want to say, you know, congratulations on on applying and winning that grant to city fabric and to our city clerk. I just want to say, this is this is fantastic. I know you played a tremendous sort of significant role here to us. A lot of times, you know, we've had conversations about, you know, cracking the code on voter turnout. And a lot of folks believe they, you know, have it down to a science. But, you know, every once in a while there's an innovative idea and it changes the way things operate across the country. And, you know, this is one of those things that I think has that has that potential. So I just want to say congratulations and thank you. And I think it's great that you came and gave a report at city council. A lot of great things happen in our city and we don't you know, sometimes we don't hear the results. And even though it's not finished, I think it's tremendous to know that that particular precinct had the highest amount of provisional ballots and that that's data and it's it's important. So thank you so much for doing that.\\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. You know, Brian, one thing also, I think this is great and I love that we're focusing on on getting people to vote. I think it's really important. I'm not sure the process that you guys will go through to select these these sites. I'm not sure if they're selected already or not. But throughout, I think it's important to certainly your target focus is trying to address precincts that have not traditionally voted, which I think is great. I also think it could be interesting to also look at a precinct if you have four, where there is maybe high turnout, but can you make that turnout even higher? You know, and so I think hopefully when you select the sites that you guys are, hopefully the sites are are are diverse as far as geographically across the city. So we're really capturing all types of voters because I think we want to encourage higher voting everywhere. Right. I mean, at the end of the day, we want voting all across the city regardless of of the district. And so I think I think that the start at low propensity areas, I think is really good. But, you know, it's also interesting to know, you know, how do we get more voters in certain high propensity Eastside districts, you know, and if that's possible as well. So just a thought and great work. This is this is good stuff. Councilman Price.\\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. I do know what everyone has said. I want to echo the accolades. You always bring fresh ideas and a fresh perspective to the city, and you think of things that others don't. And in terms of voting, we need that fresh approach. We need that fresh attitude. We're dealing with a whole new generation of people that think differently and do things differently. I'm dealing with it all the time. When we hire new attorneys in my office, they just do things differently. So in terms of training, you know, we're having to reprogram the traditional ways that we communicated. And I see that that's what you're doing with the message that you provided for us tonight. So I want to thank you for being a great partner to the city always, and especially on this project. And one of the things that I would recommend is if there's any of this that we can implement long term into our council districts. So in terms of pushing messages out or pushing marketing out, that's consistent with the logo that you're using. Please let us know. We've done a really we've been very aggressive in terms of our counsel office and trying to get the message out about voting and engaging our residents to vote, reminding them to vote. But we could use that fresh perspective, too, because creativity is not abundant on our staff. We do we deal with a lot of mundane things all day long. So I really appreciate any influx of creativity that we can get to our efforts as well. So thank you for everything that you're doing on this and the presentation tonight. It was really wonderful. Thanks.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzales.\\nSpeaker 4: Brian and Madam City Clerk, I want to thank both of you for your joint efforts and trying to engage more voters. I think the first district is not surprisingly, it is one of the lowest voter turnout in the city. And so we'd like to see that change, especially with the high rises that we have. People don't like to get out. How do we make it more accessible to them? Even youth that are starting to vote? Spanish speakers, I mean, we have an influx of different, you know, like other parts of the city as well. But I think the first district in some areas may need a little bit more attention. And I think just engaging them in that sense would be great. But I think, as my colleagues had mentioned, your creativity never ceases to amaze me. And I really appreciate your efforts in this. It's it's wonderful.\\nSpeaker 1: Everything's great. Good work, Brian. Good work to our city work team as well. Any public comment on this item? CNN members, please cast your vote and they receive and file report.\",\n          \"Speaker 0: Motion case.\\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. The staff presentation will again be given by Brett Jaquez, our business services officer. Good evening, Honorable Vice Mayor and members of the City Council. Before your recommendation to uphold the hearing officer's determination to deny the business license application, NJ 21701212. Submitted by Easy Greens LLC for Medical Marijuana Business located at 1355 West Rose Street in Council District seven. In addition to the counsel order, you have been provided the hearing officer's recommended recommendation and findings, the appeal hearing packet and the city's brief in support of its argument. To write some background on this item on February 21st, 2017, Easy Greens LLC submitted an application to operate a medical marijuana dispensary at 1355 West Grove Street on May 31st, 2017. The Department of Financial Management denied the business license application due to the proposed business location being within an area zoned exclusively for residential use, which is in violation of the Long Beach Municipal Code. Section 5.90.030. On June 8th, 2017, Easy Greens LLC filed an appeal of the business license application denial. And on July 18, 2017, the City Council referred the appeal hearing to a hearing officer on August ten, 2017. The appeal hearing was held and the presiding hearing officer assigned by the city clerk's office was Elio Palacios. On August 29, 2017, the hearing officer recommended that the denial of the business license application submitted by E-Z Green's LLC be upheld due to the proposed business location being in an area zoned exclusively for residential use, which is in violation of Long Beach Municipal Code Section 5.90.03. It is requested that the City Council accept the hearing officer's recommendation to deny this business license application. That concludes my report. And staff are available to answer any questions Council may have. Thank you. And Mr. City Attorney, do we need to ask for the appellant on this? Okay. Is there is the appellant present? Okay, please come forward. You have a reasonable amount of time to make your case. Let's just cue up 10 minutes here. I probably need that long. Okay, well, let's queue up five. Okay. Mr. Vice Mayor and City Council, thank you for giving me a chance to speak. Be a being that we applied for this this medical marijuana license. It is. It's currently zoned on is on the map. It is zoned residential. But that's that was our point of contention, why we appeal this process to begin with. My father purchased this property back on August 8th, 1980, from Mobile Oil Corporation. It was it was an existing gas station at the time. My father at that point converted it from a gas station to a convenience store dairy market, which is which is how it's been operated since that time. So for the past 37 years, it's been operated clearly as not a residential use. We we so since during that time we've had a beer and beer and wine license from state of California. And during that whole time and basically the zoning I believe we believe to be amid something made a mistake with the zoning not back in 2013. We we I think we realized that it was not zoned and we attempted to preliminarily change the zoning on this property. My father contacted various business owners along the the block that we were located on. Some of them did agree to for us to go ahead with the zone change and we would all split the cost. And then early 2014, we were approached as personally, we were approached by 7-Eleven to to purchase this building from us, along with the license, the beer and wine license. So at that time, my father tried to rush the process, going because the 7-Eleven was not going to purchase it, being zoned incorrectly. But at that time, my father, we met with Monica mendoza, who was at the was a planner at the time. And we had she and my father met with Linda, to whom was also in in the works for the city in planning. And at that time, they told us that the the zone change was already going to be part of this citywide general plan change. That's still hasn't occurred from 2014 til now. We were under the understanding that that process would have taken between six months to a year. And here we are three and a half years later and still has not been done. And I understand that there's a bunch of little hiccups that go along the way with that. But as a direct result of this this thing, we haven't been able to we were denied for this application, as well as not being able to sell our business and the building property to 7-Eleven. We've been we've definitely been harmed by this through the slow process. This is taken. And we're hoping to get this the zone change done, if possible, prior to this general planning, because we don't even know when that's going to happen. We'd like to apply for if we're not going to be able to open a dispensary, we'd like to still be in this in the medical marijuana business. But if the zoning is not changed by the time, you know, we'd like to do the cultivation side if possible. We're exploring that as well at least. But if that's yeah, that's that's basically we just want to get this thing done. This process is, you know, started from 2013 and like I said, it's been a commercial use since 1980 at least, at least. And I'm sure mobile operator discussed that as a gas station for 20 years before that. So that's all that saying. Thank you. So this time we'll get a public comment. Is there any public comment on the side of. Very good. Upfront. I don't know this specific location, but I would offer this suggestion to this city. There will be obviously a number of people that will always want to come down and we're going to try to do this. And in any neighborhood, they are problematic. Here would be my suggestion. If you feel that you have no alternative in some locations, this is what and this is what. In the final analysis you should you should do is take the top two or the next to the top floor of the Long Beach Police Department. Clear it out, rent out space, and then have a lottery. And people can apply for one of those places to operate a marijuana establishment there. And there's ample parking in the garage there for them to do that period. And that saves a considerable amount of time. It's there. They can go buy a lottery basis and for each district they will have a certain you'll work it out with a certain number of lottery spaces will be opened for each district. And then you go to the downtown, to the police department and do your stuff. The city then gets at least some revenue from it to offset the damage that will flow from being forced to sell it. Thank you. Thank you. So say no further. Is this public comment coming forward? Thank you. Is there any other public comment on this item? Okay. This is our last speaker.\\nSpeaker 5: Thank you, Shirley Bassey. With regards to the denial of this license, I believe that it is in the overall best interests of the city being the medical marijuana and the regular kind. There is no difference between the two. It's all marijuana. It's it's all doing the same thing. So we have saved some toddlers. We have saved some met middle school high school children from walking by that business and getting a contact high. We've saved the necessity of the residents to have to explain to their children, what's that smell? Mommy, Daddy, what is that? We have saved a generation that live in that area from the necessity of getting that much more closer because marijuana is a gateway drug. We've saved that many children from being that one step close to the use of opiate drugs. Heroin. We saved them. Cigarets are now in front of us. They are in some of our houses, even though we've required now smoke free zones in restaurants and other public places. Because years later. Through cancer and death. And all kind of malfeasance in our human body. We have say we are now having to answer that question. But with with marijuana, we're going down the same road. And some of us years later. Are going to hear your children say, I don't care if you do put medical in front of it, Mommy. They offered me a joint and then they said, Well, why don't you try a primo. That's marijuana kid dipped in cocaine. And then they offered that to me. Dad. And while you voted, it was illegal. You said, Mommy, that you said you voted it right, Mommy. You're going to have to answer that in the generations ahead. As your children? Some of them. Who voted. I don't care if you are selling it legally now. You're going to have to answer your children and your children's children. Mark my words, some of you will weep for this decision. When you know, deep in your heart, forget what they have allowed you to do here in your heart of hearts, you are entertaining this not because you have a medicinal necessity. You're entertaining it because it is now the trendy thing to do. When you don't want to deal with the stresses of life and the many of us who are either Catholic or Protestant. I'll finish later. Thank you.\\nSpeaker 1: So we closed public comment, but I see one additional speaker. Is this one or is this too one? This is one. So I leave that there.\\nSpeaker 3: Well, you see something? Got it, Roberto. Well, you got something to say to me. Merry Christmas.\\nSpeaker 1: You ain't got to say nothing to me. All right, so you have 3 minutes and time starts now.\\nSpeaker 3: Well, I think you give an honor to Jesus. I don't. I disagree with her because I saw a documentary on the History Channel. Nixon was giving out marijuana, medical marijuana in 73 and everything. So. And I got glaucoma, I found out in 2011. And that's the first thing the doctor said to me is marijuana has no side effect. The team along the left hand approach that I take and the Santa press makes my eyes twitch so no one is all right. You know, I use all of them. But the thing is, is marijuana back in the days was the peace pipe, not the regular tobacco marijuana. And and the Native Americans wanted the indigenous holiday and everything. They were here last week. If we had they maybe they need to smoke marijuana because when we got finished and I got kicked out, everybody remembers. Right. And this is has to do with marijuana. When they got finished, the natives, you know we used to smoke piece pipe of cool but see when we got out there I was with the white lady and the white man and Fred that was over there and the police escort is to a car because it was a little commotion. They were following us, La Raza people. So what time we get out there? I'm in the back seat. They don't see me like this has to do. I'm getting to it. They say.\\nSpeaker 1: You know. Yeah, now, come on.\\nSpeaker 3: It's not a warning. I'm talking about marijuana. Why it needs to be. Now, come on. Don't do that. Because you got to hear this. We need marijuana because I would like to smoke marijuana with them and they would have peace, not jail. The ones who was here last week and if we had back in Long Beach and I could smoke a doobie with them, maybe they wouldn't be trying to beat us up and kill us. Okay. So the thing is, is Uncle Jerry would like that, but they don't. So the thing is, as far as them, what they did, they caught us and they try to reach in to take those phone and assaulted us. And then I went to police tell them it took too long to get there. So as vice mayor, before I leave, I want to ask you this. I want to make sure I wanted to make sure that step doesn't happen again because, hey, we come here to talk, not to fight, but if we got to be our own police, I'll do that and I'll go get some brothers a hand with that . But I don't want to do that because I don't feel like going to jail. And that's why we got the police. We got good police here. I remember when crack was all up in Long Beach. That was such a good job that this is a very safe city now. So just I just tell the police what's up and let me handle this because they handle this in Long Beach and hey, remember, next time they come with this indigenous stuff, when we get out there, I ain't having no more of that bull crap because the brother ain't having it. I'm gonna get some brothers down here. We're going to handle this. That's the last thing I'm saying. So, you know, hey, tell that man to handle his all that stuff. Hey, I ain't going down Long Beach.\\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And we didn't see Frances come forward. Francis, you have your 3 minutes.\\nSpeaker 8: I am Francis, Emily Dawson Harris and I reside in District one and I wholeheartedly support this surge and this matter. I felt that the hearing officer's recommendation is sound and is and should be about the denial of the business license. I'm also staying on the subject matter. I kind of was listening to the appellant and I just was wondering about a point of clarification because I kind of got a inclination that there's a possibility that he realizes there's a probability that the license may be denied. And I'm kind of concerned about the matter about still having a business or something there. And I don't know if there's a separate business license that has to be got for. I'm kind of wondering what's going to happen with this denied? What's going to happen with the facility? Because I think that needs to be made clear as to what's actually going to happen with this location. Thank you very much and I appreciate it.\\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Public comment is close. We'll take it back behind the wheel. Councilmember Durango. Thank you, vice mayor. I know. I know. That little stretch of land between the river, the 17 freeway and Santa Fe as well. This property lies around the corner of Easy and Little Street, and it has been a dairy for town that I've been in Long Beach. But I wasn't sure. I wasn't aware about the early history that it was a gas station. So that's that's enlightening. We were saying that has been very difficult for Mr. Wayne and his son in their property is that they have made efforts to sell that property and make it something else and convert that use into something much more not only useful for the community but profitable for them. Of course, during the course of my being on the city council, it was revealed at that location it's what they call a legal non-conforming use, which complicates matters in terms of properties that are that are designated as such. So I want to ask our planet, our department service people, if they could please give a definition of legal or performing use so that we can proceed with with how we move forward with the time of the sale here. Kerry. I will respond to that.\\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Good evening, Honorable City Council, and thank you for your question, Councilmember Miranda. The legal, legal nonconforming use is one that was approved, legally permitted during a certain time, and then subsequently the codes changed. So, for example, for this particular property, it was zoned commercial back in the forties and fifties and sometime prior to 1979 it was zoned residential. And the existing development on the site, which was permitted legally at the time, remains legal, non-conforming and status, even though the underlying the zoning is are one which is residential and now only allows for residential uses.\\nSpeaker 1: And and that that presents a quandary because it is a legal non-conforming use. Yet it was resolved to be residential and and so Mr. Wang feels that he's been treated unfairly and I don't blame him for that because he's not. Now at this point when he was trying to sell the property to 7-Eleven because 11 does sell wine and beer, he could no longer be that type of service. He could no longer be there. So he's of in a in a quite a quandary here in terms of what was he going to do with that property. It's not about marijuana. It's about his property and what he can do with it at this point. And it's a shame that that he was unable to at least be able to consider another use for that property. But then the law is a law. We did pass a measure m m it was the definitions are very clear in terms of where you could put some dispensaries and some growth. And being that this is in a place where there's a residential very nearby, he can't they can't convert that property into that. Also, when he did his application, there were a maximum of 23 points to achieve in the application. And he didn't he didn't get the 23 points. So he was deemed eligible to continue in the lottery. So at this point, it appears that Mr. Wang is not able to apply for a medical marijuana dispensary or apply for 7-Eleven or apply for any other use, which is a shame. So at this point I would like to direct staff of the audit services and Mr. Kaiser to please meet with the Wangs, talk to them, give them some ideas as to what would be a very usable, well appropriate use of that property that may be able to give them some relief and and give them an opportunity to stay along because it's been a long time for 30 plus years, they've become a part of the community. They also own the car wash down the street on the corner of Santa Fe and and well, so they they are very familiar with Long Beach. They're very familiar to the people who are who live in the West Palm Beach area. And I think that they deserve a fair shake. So, Mr. Warwick, is that possible that we can be able to work with the banks and this mayor, councilmembers, vice mayor, councilmembers, certainly will have an economic development department meet with the Wangs, talk about zoning, what opportunities that exist. Absolutely. Okay. All right. And again, you know, this this is a parallel situations where I did meet with planning a building during this period of time. We were talking about 711 and how the land you sell that was coming in. And we're looking at changing some of those those those rules. And that is one of the stretches right there that is very complicated because of that corner and plus the other properties that are to the west of him, where there's a church, there's a laundromat, there's a restaurant, and there's a a playground and a library. So it's very mixed and it's very a talk about nonconforming. I don't know what that street is in terms of where there's residential, whether it's commercial or what. It's very unclear. So we as we move forward, we're probably touching a little button here that they should at least wear this item. But it's it's something that we really need to clarify and get clear and territory that stretch land so that Mr. Wang and his son can can have an appropriate use of that property. So having said all of that, I recommend that we go ahead and accept the the recommendation of the of the administrative judge and move forward . I hope my colleagues will as well. Thank you. Thank you. And that motion has been moved and seconded. Councilman Art and any remarks?\\nSpeaker 3: No, I think Councilman Urunga made the case and I support his motion.\\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Those are remarks. So members to. Catch a vote.\\nSpeaker 0: Gonzales motion case.\\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. So that concludes our hearings. So I just want to clarify the order of the meeting this evening. So right now we have just a few people queued up for public comment.

So could you maybe talk through why this increase is being proposed?\\nSpeaker 4: Councilmember Price Yes, good evening. And I'm going to ask Eric Romero, our business development.\\nSpeaker 5: Coordinator who works with the Parking Commission, to talk a little bit about the need for this.\\nSpeaker 4: Assessment. And we.\\nSpeaker 5: Also have our treasurer, David Nakamoto, who's here with us tonight as well with regard to the establishment and administration.\\nSpeaker 4: At the CFTC. Good evening, Mayor, and.\\nSpeaker 3: Members of the city council. My name is Eric Romero. And so, yes, we've the rate for the CFD has been set at about $0.12 per commercial square.\\nSpeaker 5: Foot since.\\nSpeaker 3: 2006.\\nSpeaker 5: And.\\nSpeaker 3: Mainly due to the increase of the the cost.\\nSpeaker 4: Associated with.\\nSpeaker 5: Administrating the different payments associated with paying down the bond and also the increase in the debt.\\nSpeaker 3: Annual payments. We're recommending an increase to that to the rate, which is the.\\nSpeaker 5: First increase in.\\nSpeaker 3: About 12 years.\\nSpeaker 5: And if there's anything else that you would.\\nSpeaker 3: Like to add, Treasurer.\\nSpeaker 4: That.\\nSpeaker 7: Okay. Are there any have there been any concerns on your end in terms of people not paying? And is this is this what we've referred to as the salaries?\\nSpeaker 4: Yes, it is.\\nSpeaker 7: So are there some concerns with people not paying the lowest tax?\\nSpeaker 4: So we.\\nSpeaker 3: Pose that question to the consultant that we work with to pay down the.\\nSpeaker 5: Debt service.\\nSpeaker 3: And as of.\\nSpeaker 5: Today, there are only delinquent installments related to the 20 1718 billing and.\\nSpeaker 3: Only represent about 8.63%.\\nSpeaker 5: Of the 20 1718 billing. So there are no delinquencies for any prior fiscal year. Delinquencies in this district are considered to be low historically, and they generally do not last longer than one year.\\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\\nSpeaker 7: How are we going to ensure moving forward that we're capturing all the payments and that the the property owners who are paying their assessments in a timely fashion are not shouldering the burden of those who aren't fulfilling their own self-assessment obligations.\\nSpeaker 3: The county treasurer and tax collector.\\nSpeaker 5: Sent out delinquency notices just before the end of the fiscal year to notify the delinquent property owners that their delinquencies will become.\\nSpeaker 3: Defaulted on July one. The CFT 27 does to the Miller, who does have a foreclosure covenant that.\\nSpeaker 5: Calls for the city to take action against delinquent parcels if an individual parcel is delinquent for.\\nSpeaker 3: 20 $500 or more, or if overall.\\nSpeaker 5: Delinquency percentage.\\nSpeaker 3: Exceeds 5%, the city can take action prior to these conditions being met.\\nSpeaker 5: The typical procedure for dealing with delinquencies includes sending a reminder letter, then a demand letter, then removing installments from the textual then or foreclosure letter, then turning over delinquencies to a foreclosure attorney. We typically wait for delinquencies to be substantial before moving towards foreclosure, and that.\\nSpeaker 3: Process.\\nSpeaker 5: Involves fees for our consultant.\\nSpeaker 3: Members.\\nSpeaker 5: The county and a foreclosure attorney.\\nSpeaker 7: Have we done any sort of analysis of the standard property size on these assessments to determine what the monetary impact of. A The increase would be the .03 cents. Do we know how much more it would be to a standard property there? Their annual assessment. The range may be.\\nSpeaker 12: Councilmember Price I'd like to field that question. When the community facilities district was formed. It was by the vote of the property owners. And at that time, they they voted to self-assess themselves. An engineering report was prepared at that time that allowed for a maximum of $0.66 per square foot. We are far from that level at this point.\\nSpeaker 7: Okay, great. Thank you. I appreciate that. It was my goal to get you to talk at a council meeting. So there we go. Congratulations.

Ordinance to create the Boston Commemoration Commission submits a report recommending that the ordinance ought to pass in a new draft.\\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. The chair recognizes Councilor Edward's counsel. Edward, you have the floor.\\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much. Docket 0368 again is the work of Councilor Kenzie Bach, who I think has been leading in general and the historic preservation and understanding of our history on the council. And I wanted to thank her for that and thank her for this commemoration commission. It would establish a commemoration commission with the purpose of developing a plan to celebrate upcoming historical anniversaries of significance to Boston and to make sure that that celebration is inclusive, it's accurate, and it actually includes everybody in the diverse history of Boston. The ordinance establishes the membership of the Commission, the creation of the subcommittees, and defines the responsibilities and authority of the commission. And I believe, as this commission will continue to grow and be diverse and make sure that we are always accurate and inclusive of all aspects of our history and how every single one of us in our backgrounds played a role in building this beautiful city. So I would like to turn it over with your permission to Councilor Bach, and I recommend that this order pass or excuse me that this ordinance passed and amended form.\\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. The Chair recognizes Councilor Bach Council. Bach, you have the floor.\\nSpeaker 6: Thank you so much, Madam President. As Councilor Edwards alluded to upcoming anniversaries, they provide us with an opportunity to both plan commemorative events and update our local and state laws concerning historic buildings and archives in ways that more fully preserve and honor a history that includes all Bostonians. And I think it's clear to us that there's a ton of opportunity here and not just originally for some folks on the council. Remember that I filed this thinking about this Hester Centennial, the 250th for 2026 of the country. But also, as we're on a path to the 2030 400th anniversary of the city of Boston, and we know that there's an opportunity to really tell our history in ways that include everyone in our interaction, as Councilor Edward says. But we also know that doesn't happen by accident or on autopilot. You have to be intentional about it. And so the purpose of the commission is really to pull the many pieces of our city that touch historical memory and the many stakeholders we have around of our neighborhoods, sort of into conversation together and coordinate and invest in inclusive and robust historical resources and preservation tools while telling the full range of our history, including the struggles and accomplishments of Boston's indigenous, black, immigrant, women's and LGBTQ plus communities who who have historically often been left out of our official narratives. Um, as it says in the ordinance, this ordinance affirms that our diverse and intertwined community histories are of great value to the city of Boston and its residents. The historical tourism should be a driver of true shared prosperity. That inclusive and honest historical memory is a crucial public good worthy of our attention and resources, and that communities all over the city should have the tools and resources to research, preserve, acknowledge and celebrate their history. And, you know, the aim here is to have everything from local history modules in in veeps to local people, library branches , having exhibits about that neighborhood's history, local trails. You know, as we talk about 2026, there is as much revolutionary history in Dorchester as there is downtown. We need to be really working together to tell that whole story and have everybody's voices. And so I'm just really thankful to the city departments that have participated in crafting this ordinance and all the advocates who have added their thoughts.
