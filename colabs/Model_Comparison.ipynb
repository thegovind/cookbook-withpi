              "<p>“Oh, what a beautiful bird!” Finley called up to the Crow, his voice dripping with honey. \"Such magnificent feathers! They shimmer in the sunlight like a thousand tiny jewels.\"</p>\n",

              "<p>The Crow, completely taken in by Finley's flattery, forgot all about the cheese. She opened her beak wide to sing, \"Caw!\"</p>\n",

              "<p>Barnaby Badger loved berries. He loved squishy blueberries, tart raspberries, and plump blackberries most of all. One day, Barnaby was sniffing under a particularly large blackberry bush when he heard a voice.</p>\n",
              "<p>\"Good morning, most handsome Barnaby!\"</p>\n",
              "<p>Barnaby startled and looked up. Perched on a branch was Cecil Crow. Cecil was known for his booming caw and even boomier ego.</p>\n",
              "<p>\"Er, good morning, Cecil,\" Barnaby mumbled, continuing his search for the juiciest berries.</p>\n",
              "<p>\"Surely a badger as refined as you isn't content with just <em>any</em> blackberry,\" Cecil crooned. \"No, no.

              "<p>Barnaby blushed. He had always thought his fur was a little… ordinary.</p>\n",
              "<p>\"Follow me, my discerning friend,\" Cecil said, taking flight. Barnaby eagerly followed, pushing through bushes and stumbling over roots, all the while Cecil showered him with compliments. \"Such graceful movements for a badger! Such keen eyesight to navigate these tricky paths!\"</p>\n",
              "<p>Finally, they arrived at a clearing. Barnaby's eyes widened. There, nestled in a hollow, were the biggest, shiniest blackberries he had ever seen.</p>\n",

              "<p>Barnaby rushed forward, mouth watering. He grabbed a huge berry and popped it into his mouth. He chewed… and frowned. It tasted… awful. Bitter and hard.</p>\n",
              "<p>\"What do you think?\" Cecil asked, preening.</p>\n",
              "<p>Barnaby tried another berry. Still awful. \"These… these aren't very good,\" he said, disappointed.</p>\n",
              "<p>Cecil chuckled. \"Oh, they're perfectly adequate. But I needed to get you away from those <em>other</em> berries, the ones you were so diligently searching for.\" He hopped down to the base of a nearby tree and began pecking at a pile of discarded berry skins. \"You see, <em>I</em> wanted those delicious berries all to myself. And your… well, your vanity made it so easy.\"</p>\n",
              "<p>Barnaby, realizing he’d been fooled, felt a pang of shame. He glared at Cecil, who was now cawing with laughter. Barnaby turned and trudged back to his original blackberry bush, a wiser badger. He found the berries there, while not the biggest, were sweet and satisfying.</p>\n",
