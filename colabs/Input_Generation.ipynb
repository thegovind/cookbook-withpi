              "<p>A sly fox, known throughout the forest for his cunning, stumbled upon a plump goose nestled amongst tall reeds.  The goose, oblivious to the fox's approach, was happily gobbling down juicy berries.  The fox, his eyes gleaming with greed, crept closer.</p>\n",

As she led him through the forest, the other animals watched, shaking their heads.  They had heard many stories about the fox’s lies, but today, they witnessed the fox's trouble, firsthand.  The fox, feeling the weight of his dishonesty, finally understood the folly of his ways.  From that day forward, though he still held his cunning, he learned to speak the truth, for honesty, he discovered, was often the best policy.</p>\n",

              "<p>Barnaby the beagle, a dog of unwavering loyalty, loved to play fetch.  He would race across the meadow, retrieving a brightly coloured ball, his tail wagging furiously.  He always brought it back to his friend, Sheldon the turtle, who patiently waited, a thoughtful expression on his shell.  \"I promise,\" Barnaby would bark, \"I'll bring it back, Sheldon!\"</p>\n",

He found Barnaby's promise delightful, but Sheldon's memory was as slow as his shell.  He often forgot what he was supposed to do, what he had said he would do.</p>\n",
              "<p>One sunny afternoon, Barnaby bounded across the meadow, the ball held high.  He zipped and zoomed, his paws pounding the earth. \"I promise, Sheldon!\" he barked,  \"I'll get you the ball!\"</p>\n",
              "<p>Sheldon, nestled amongst the reeds, nodded.  He saw the ball, but as Barnaby played hide-and-seek with the tall grasses, Sheldon pondered the best way to collect berries, forgetting his promise.</p>\n",

              "<p>Barnaby, disappointed, lowered the ball.  He looked at Sheldon, who looked up, startled, then back at the ball.   A flicker of understanding touched Sheldon’s shell.  \"Oh, Barnaby,\" Sheldon mumbled, \"I had forgotten.\"</p>\n",
              "<p>Barnaby wagged his tail slowly, understanding now, too.  The game couldn’t continue until the promise was met.  He gently placed the ball at Sheldon's feet.  Sheldon, realizing his forgetfulness, felt a pang of regret. From that day forward, Sheldon made a conscious effort to remember his promises, and Barnaby knew that, even with a forgetful friend, loyalty and promises were important.</p>\n",

              "<p>Tiny Terrapin, a young turtle with a shell the color of a summer sky, longed for the glittering, juicy berries that grew high atop the tallest fig tree.  Every day, he'd watch the swift rabbits and the nimble squirrels scamper up the tree, their paws reaching for the prize.  Frustrated, Terrapin tried to climb, but his legs, though strong, were slow.  He'd slip and slide, his shell scraping against the bark, each fall a fresh pang of disappointment.</p>\n",

He was about to give up, ready to accept a life of humble, leafy greens, when he saw a wise old owl perched on a branch.</p>\n",

Consider the berries; they are ripe, and sweet, because the tree has taken its time nurturing them.  Just as the tree needs time to grow the berries, you need time to achieve your goals.\"</p>\n",
              "<p>Terrapin thought about this. He carefully observed the squirrels and rabbits, noticing how their speed often led them to lose their grip.  With a deep breath, he decided to try a different strategy. He chose a slow, steady climb, taking his time with each step, focusing on each patch of bark beneath his feet.  He carefully assessed the angle of each incline, never rushing.  And finally, after what seemed like an eternity, he reached the top.  The juicy, glistening berries, plump and delicious, awaited him.</p>\n",
              "<p>He savored each one, appreciating the fruits of his careful climb.  The rabbits and squirrels, who had rushed past him countless times, were now watching, their eyes wide.  The wise owl nodded with satisfaction, knowing Terrapin had learned a valuable lesson.  From that day on, Terrapin always climbed with patience and thought, and he always found that the sweetest rewards came to those who persevered.</p>\n",

              "<p>Barnaby the squirrel was renowned for his impulsive nature.  Every plump nut, every juicy berry, every glistening acorn sparked a mad dash in his tiny heart.  He’d scamper, snatch, and stash, a whirlwind of frantic activity.  But he’d often leave behind treasures, scattering nuts, and dropping berries.  Winter always arrived too soon, and Barnaby would find himself shivering in his flimsy nest, his larder bare.</p>\n",

Observe the steadfast chipmunk, Clementine. She gathers meticulously, one nut at a time, and she holds back on the sweet things until the nuts are secure.\"</p>\n",

The other squirrels, who had succumbed to their cravings and scattered their stores, huddled in the cold, shivering and hungry.  Barnaby, nestled warmly in his well-stocked nest, had a feast.</p>\n",

Resisting the allure of immediate pleasure, focusing on diligent, methodical work, led to a richer harvest than the fleeting joy of impulsive grabs.

He nibbled and savored, enjoying every crunchy bite.  He realised that happiness didn't come from stuffing himself full, but from appreciating the joy of eating properly.  And his tummy, thankfully, was much happier too.</p>\n",
