He focused on one step at a time, and slowly but surely, he began to make progress. The other frogs watched in amazement as Croaky climbed higher and higher. They cheered him on, and soon they were all rooting for him.\\n\\nFinally, after many days of climbing, Croaky reached the top of the mountain. He was exhausted but exhilarated. He looked out at the breathtaking view and felt an overwhelming sense of pride and accomplishment.\\n\\nAs he made his way back down the mountain, the other frogs greeted him as a hero. \"We were wrong to doubt you,\" they said. \"You\\'re the most determined frog we\\'ve ever met!\" Croaky smiled and said, \"It\\'s not about being the biggest or the strongest. It\\'s about persevering, no matter what. If I can climb a mountain, you can achieve your dreams too.\"\\n\\nFrom that day on, Croaky became known as the greatest climber in the land. And he lived happily ever after, inspiring others to chase their dreams and never give up, no matter how impossible they may seem.')\n",
            "Example(llm_input='Give me a fable that shows the benefits of listening to wise advice.', llm_output='In a dense jungle, there lived a young and ambitious monkey named Max. Max was known for his cleverness and agility, but he was also very stubborn and rarely listened to others. One day, while Max was out exploring, he stumbled upon a wise old owl perched on a tree branch. The owl, whose name was Olwen, looked at Max with her big, round eyes and said, \"Max, I see that you are a talented and resourceful monkey, but I also sense that you are headed for trouble. The jungle is full of dangers, and if you don\\'t learn to listen to wise advice, you will surely fall into harm\\'s way.\"\\n\\nMax laughed at Olwen\\'s warning and said, \"I don\\'t need anyone\\'s advice. I can take care of myself.\" Olwen looked at Max with a mixture of sadness and concern, but she didn\\'t push the issue. Instead, she said, \"Very well, Max. If you ever need help, don\\'t hesitate to come to me. But for now, I will give you a small test. Follow the path to the left, and you will find a beautiful garden filled with juicy fruits and sweet honey. But be warned, the path to the right is treacherous and will lead you to a steep cliff.\"\\n\\nMax, being the stubborn monkey that he was, decided to ignore Olwen\\'s advice and follow the path to the right. As he walked, the path became narrower and steeper, and Max found himself slipping and sliding on the loose rocks. Just as he was about to reach the edge of the cliff, he heard a loud rumbling sound, and the ground gave way beneath him. Max fell into a deep ravine, injuring his arm and leg.\\n\\nAs he lay there, helpless and in pain, Max realized that he should have listened to Olwen\\'s wise advice. He slowly made his way back to Olwen\\'s tree, where he found the old owl waiting for him. Olwen looked at Max with a knowing glance and said, \"I told you, Max, that the path to the right was treacherous. But I also told you that I would be here to help you if you needed it. Now, let me help you heal your wounds and teach you the value of listening to wise advice.\"\\n\\nMax was grateful for Olwen\\'s help and guidance. He learned that listening to wise advice can save you from harm and lead you to great rewards. From that day on, Max made it a point to listen to Olwen and other wise creatures in the jungle, and he became known as one of the most prudent and successful monkeys in the land. Max\\'s story spread, teaching all the animals in the jungle the importance of listening to wise advice and seeking guidance from those who are wiser and more experienced.')\n"
